#Aluum
Immunity to Magic			KEY:Immunity to Magic ~ Aluum			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Immunity	SOURCEPAGE:p.307	DESC:An aluum is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature.

A magical attack that uses positive energy slows the aluum as if by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and dispels any haste effects currently affecting it. Magic jar confuses the creature for 1d6 rounds.
