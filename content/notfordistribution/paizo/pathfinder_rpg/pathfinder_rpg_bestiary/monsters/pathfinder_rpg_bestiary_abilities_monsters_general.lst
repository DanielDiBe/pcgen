Grab			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption	VISIBLE:YES																				DESC:If you hit with the indicated attack, you deal normal damage and can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Grab only works against opponets at least on size category smaller than you. You have the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of your body you used in the grab to hold the opponent. If you choose to do the latter, you take a -20 penalty on your CMB check to make and maintain the grappel, but do not gain the grappled condition yourself. Each successful grapple check you make during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold.

Scent			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			VISIBLE:YES																				DESC:You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. You can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When you a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When you are within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source’s location.

Trample		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:TrampleDamageDice|0	DEFINE:TrampleDamageDieSize|0	DEFINE:TrampleDamageBonus|0	DEFINE:TrampleDC|0	DESC:As a full-round action, you can attempt to overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than you. This works just like the combat maneuver, but you do not need to make a check, and rather merely have to move over opponents in your path. Targets of a trample take %1d%2+%3 points of damage. Targets of the trample can make an attack of opportunity but at a -4 penalty. If targets forego an attack of opportunity, they can attempt to avoid you and receive a Reflex save (DC %4) to take half damage. You can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.|TrampleDamageDice|TrampleDamageDieSize|TrampleDamageBonus|TrampleDC																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													BONUS:VAR|TrampleDamageBonus|STR*3/2	BONUS:VAR|TrampleDC|10+(HD/2)+STR	BONUS:VAR|TrampleDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Trample)				SOURCEPAGE:p.X
Trip			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption	VISIBLE:YES																				DESC:You can attempt to trip your opponent as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity if you hit with the specified attack. If the attempt fails, you are not tripped in return.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.X
Whirlwind		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.AttackOption	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:WhirlwindDuration|0	DEFINE:WhirlwindHeight|0	DEFINE:WhirlwindDC|0						DESC:You can transform yourself into a whirlwind and remain in that form for up to %1 rounds. If you have a fly, you can continue to fly at that same speed while in whirlwind form, otherwise you gain a fly speed equal to your base land speed (average maneuverability) while in whirlwind form. The whirlwind is always 5 feet wide at its base. A whirlwind’s width at its peak is always equal to half of its height. You control the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet and at most %2 feet high. The whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if you enter the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the whirlwind moves into or through a creature’s space. In whirlwind form you cannot make your normal attacks, and you do not threaten the area around you. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the whirlwind might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (generally damage equal your slam attack) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %3) when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take damage as if it were hit by the your slam attack. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the whirlwind carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. The whirlwind can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind’s volume. The whirlwind can eject any carried creatures whenever you wish as a free action, depositing them in your space. If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|WhirlwindDuration|WhirlwindHeight|WhirlwindDC	BONUS:VAR|WhirlwindDuration|TL/2	BONUS:VAR|WhirlwindDC|10+(TL/2)+STR															SOURCEPAGE:p.306
