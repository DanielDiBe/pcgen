SOURCEPAGE:p. 144	BENEFIT:The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane.

To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours.
