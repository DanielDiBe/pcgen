Mucus Cloud		KEY:Mucus Cloud ~ Aboleth	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.Aura	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:MucusCloudDC|0	DESC:While underwater, an aboleth exudes a cloud of transparent slime. All creatures adjacent to an aboleth must succeed on a DC %1 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 3 hours.

The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as it persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack.|SlimeDC	BONUS:VAR|SlimeDC|10+(TL/2)+CON		SOURCEPAGE:p.8
