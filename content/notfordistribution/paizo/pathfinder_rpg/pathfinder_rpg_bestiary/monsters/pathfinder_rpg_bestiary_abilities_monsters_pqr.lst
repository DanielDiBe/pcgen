# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability			Type												Define																								Description																																																																																																																													Source Page								Modify VAR
Self-Resurrection	KEY:Self-Resurrection ~ Phoenix	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Defensive																																	DESC:A slain phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds, unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate, at which time fully healed phoenix emerges from the remains as if brought back to life via resurrection.		SOURCEPAGE:p.227			BENEFIT:A slain phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully healed phoenix emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via resurrection. The phoenix gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs, although most use greater restoration to remove this negative level as soon as possible. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year. If a phoenix dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A phoenix that dies within the area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the desecrate effect ends, at which point the phoenix immediately resurrects. A phoenix brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.
Shroud of Flame		KEY:Shroud of Flame ~ Phoenix	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Aura						DEFINE:ShroudofFireDC|0							DESC:A phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action.				SOURCEPAGE:p.227									BENEFIT:A phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, it inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within reach (20 feet for most phoenixes) must make a DC %1 Reflex save each round to avoid taking 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the phoenix with natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit.|ShroudofFireDC
Regeneration		KEY:Regeneration ~ Phoenix		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyHP			DEFINE:RegenerationRate|0					DESC:You are difficult to kill.			SOURCEPAGE:p.303	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|%1|RegenerationRate																	BENEFIT:You are difficult to kill. You heal damage at %1 points per round, as with fast healing, but you cannot die as long as your regeneration is still functioning (although you still fall unconscious when their hit points are below 0). Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, cause your regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack. During this round, you cannot heal any damage and can die normally. Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage are not healed by regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. You can regrow lost portions of you body and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.|RegenerationRate		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(Cold or Evil)

Invisibility				KEY:Invisibility ~ Pixie	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Defensive																											DESC:A pixie remains invisible even when it attacks. This ability is constant, but the pixie can suppress or resume it as a free action.		SOURCEPAGE:p.228
Special Arrows				KEY:Special Arrows ~ Pixie	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DEFINE:SpecialArrowDC|0			DESC:As a free action, when a pixie fires an arrow from any bow, it can decide to change the arrow’s properties by sprinkling it with magical pixie dust.	SOURCEPAGE:p.228		BONUS:VAR|SpecialArrowDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA		BENEFIT:When a pixie fires an arrow from any bow, it can decide to change the arrow’s properties by sprinkling it with magical pixie dust. Doing so is a free action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow. A pixie can use this dust %1 times each day. The dust is useless to another creature unless the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow when it is applied, and it takes a standard action to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie’s chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not inflict damage when it hits; it only causes its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of the following three effects when dusting an arrow, Charm, Memory Loss or Sleep.|CHASCORE		ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(charm, memory loss or sleep arrows)
Special Charm Arrow			KEY:Charm ~ Pixie			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:Charm; The target must succeed on a DC %1 Will save or be affected as though by a Charm Monster spell for 10 minutes.|SpecialArrowDC	SOURCEPAGE:p.228

This effect can only eliminate the previous 5 minutes of memory—a pixie typically uses this ability to make the target forget it encountered the pixie so it won’t chase the pixie when he flees.|SpecialArrowDC	SOURCEPAGE:p.228
