###Block: Xill Abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type								Define					Description																										Source Page		Aspects								Description of the Benefits
Implant			KEY:Implant ~ Xill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary									DESC:As a standard action, a xill can lay 2d6 eggs in a helpless creature.															SOURCEPAGE:p.283										BENEFIT:As a standard action, a xill can lay 2d6 eggs in a helpless creature. A xill's eggs hatch in 24 hours, at which point the young consume the host from within, inflicting 1 point of Con damage per hour per young until the host dies. The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal Plane, if possible, to mature. A remove disease spell (or similar effect) rids a victim of all implanted eggs or active young, or they can be cut out one at a time with DC 20 Heal checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If a check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.
Multiweapon Mastery	KEY:Multiweapon Mastery ~ Xill	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary									DESC:A xill never takes penalties to an attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons, and treats claws as primary attacks even when also wielding weapons.	SOURCEPAGE:p.283
Planewalk			KEY:Planewalk ~ Xill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ModifyMovement							DESC:A xill can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a move action.													SOURCEPAGE:p.283										BENEFIT:A xill can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a move action. Shifting from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane takes 2 consecutive full-round actions, during which time the xill is immobile. As a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: opponents have a 20%% miss chance in the first round and a 50%% miss chance in the second. A xill can take a single willing or helpless creature with it when it switches planes.
Paralysis			KEY:Paralysis ~ Xill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary			DEFINE:ParalysisDC|10+(HD/2)+CON	DESC:You can render your victims immobile for 1d4 hours, DC 16																	SOURCEPAGE:p.283	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(1d4 hours, DC %1)|ParalysisDC

Earth Glide		KEY:Earth Glide ~ Xorn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyMovement	DESC:A xorn can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water.	SOURCEPAGE:p.284	BENEFIT:A xorn can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves no sign of its passage nor hint at its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a xorn moves the xorn back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
