# Exarch Abilities:
Spells			KEY:Spells ~ Exarch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:Exarchs cannot cast spells with the chaotic descriptor.
Inflexible Will		KEY:Inflexible Will ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, an exarch gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against confusion and insanity effects and effects with the chaotic descriptor. This ability replaces monster lore.
Detect Chaos		KEY:Detect Chaos ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At will, an exarch can use detect chaos. This ability replaces detect alignment.
Fearsome Jurist		KEY:Fearsome Jurist ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, an exarch can imbue one of her weapons with the jurist or menacing weapon special ability as a swift action, and may switch between these properties as a swift action. When using either special ability, her weapon's critical threat range doubles against chaotic creatures. This does not stack with keen edge, Improved Critical, or similar effects. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces bane.
Aura of Repetition	KEY:Aura of Repetition ~ Exarch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, once per day while using her judgment, an exarch can project an aura of repetition, as the Toil subdomain power (Advanced Player's Guide 97). If the exarch takes Artifice (Toil) as her domain, the save DC of her aura increases by 2 but its duration does not increase. This ability replaces her second judgment.
Double Jeopardy		KEY:Double Jeopardy ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 12th level, whenever an exarch uses her fearsome jurist ability, she may choose to affect two weapons, with one gaining the jurist weapon special ability and the other the menacing special ability as above. Both special abilities may be combined in a single weapon, whose critical threat range doubles. This does not stack with keen edge, Improved Critical, or similar effects. This ability replaces greater bane.
Aura of Reversion		KEY:Aura of Reversion ~ Exarch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 16th level, while using her judgment, an exarch can project a 30-foot-radius emanation for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. Any creature other than the exarch that is using a transmutation effect within this aura at the beginning of its turn becomes sickened, or sickened and nauseated if using a polymorph effect, including the change shape ability (Fortitude negates; DC 10 + 1/2 the exarch's level + her Wisdom modifier). Continuous effects from permanent magical items do not cause this effect. Within the aura, dispel checks against transmutation effects gain a +4 bonus. This ability cannot be used simultaneously with aura of repetition. This ability replaces her third judgment.

# Foehammer Abilities:
Sledgehammer		KEY:Sledgehammer ~ Foehammer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a foehammer wielding a hammer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks made to bull rush, overrun, sunder, or trip.

Weapon Training		KEY:Weapon Training ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 5th level, a foehammer must select hammers and does not gain weapon training with other groups, though his weapon training bonus improves by +1 every four levels after 5th.
Hammer to the Ground	KEY:Hammer to the Ground ~ Foehammer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, when a foehammer succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver, he can make a trip combat maneuver at the end of the bull rush. If he does not move with the target, the force of his blow may still trip his foe, but he takes a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check to trip. At 15th level, any creature a foehammer successfully bull rushes is automatically knocked prone at the end of the bull rush. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 4.
Rhythmic Blows		KEY:Rhythmic Blows ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 9th level, each time that a foehammer hits a target, he gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls against that target. This bonus stacks with each hit against that target, but lasts only until the end of the foehammer's turn. This ability replaces weapon training 2.
Piledriver			KEY:Piledriver ~ Foehammer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group. If the attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces armor training 3.
Ground Breaker		KEY:Ground Breaker ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 13th level, as a full-round action, a foehammer may strike the ground with his hammer. If the attack deals more damage than the f loor's hardness, the space he occupies and all adjacent squares become difficult terrain. Creatures in those squares, except for the foehammer, are knocked prone (DC 15 Ref lex negates). This ability replaces weapon training 3.
Hammer Master		KEY:Hammer Master ~ Foehammer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 17th level, any combat feats a foehammer has learned with any weapon from the hammer weapon training group (e.g., Improved Critical, Weapon Focus) apply to all weapons from that group. This ability replaces weapon training 4.
Devastating Blow		KEY:Devastating Blow ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 19th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group at a -5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical threat. Weapon special abilities that only activate on a critical hit do not activate if this critical hit is confirmed. This ability replaces armor mastery.
Weapon Mastery		KEY:Weapon Mastery ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A foehammer must choose a weapon from the hammer group. [Needs to be implemented]

These runes last 1 round per cleric level, but inscribing the same rune twice on an item increases this duration to 1 minute per level, three times to 10 minutes per level, and four times to 1 hour per level. Erase affects runes as magical writing. A forgemaster learns forgemaster's blessing at 1st level and may learn one additional rune at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Only one type of rune marked with an asterisk (*) may be placed on an item at any given time. This ability replaces channel energy.

# Stonelord Abilities:
Stonestrike		KEY:Stonestrike ~ Stonelord		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day per paladin level, a stonelord can draw upon the power of the living rock.

Stoneblood		KEY:Stoneblood ~ Stonelord		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a stonelord's vitals begin to calcify and her blood transforms into liquid stone.

This does not stack with fortification armor or similar effects. At 9th level, this chance increases to 50%% and she becomes immune to petrification. At 15th level, this chance increases to 75%% and she becomes immune to bleed and blood drain effects. This ability replaces divine health and her mercies gained at 3rd, 9th, and 15th level.
Defensive Stance	KEY:Defensive Stance ~ Stonelord	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 4th level, a stonelord gains the defensive stance ability, as a stalwart defender (Advanced Player's Guide 277), and may select one defensive power at 8th level and every four levels thereafter. Levels of stalwart defender stack with her paladin levels when determining the total number of rounds that she can maintain her defensive stance per day.

By spending 2 uses of her stonestrike ability, she may ignore any cover less than total cover provided by stone or metal, and she ignores any AC bonus from stone or metal armor or shields as if wielding a brilliant energy weapon. A phase strike cannot damage constructs, objects, or creatures with the earth subtype, but unlike a brilliant energy weapon, it can harm undead. This ability replaces her 12th-level mercy.
Mobile Defense	KEY:Mobile Defense ~ Stonelord	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 18th level, a stonelord can make one 5-foot step per round while maintaining her defensive stance. This ability replaces her 18th-level mercy.

###Block: Gunslinger Archetype -------------------------
Experimental Gunsmith	KEY:Gunslinger Archetype ~ Experimental Gunsmith	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype.GunslingerFirearmTraining1.GunslingerFirearmTraining2.GunslingerFirearmTraining3.GunslingerFirearmTraining4	PRECLASS:1,Gunslinger=1	PRERACE:1,Gnome%	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Gunslinger Archetype ~ Experimental Gunsmith],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining1,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining2,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining3,TYPE.GunslingerFirearmTraining4]	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith is obsessed with creating the ultimate firearm, and is willing to take risks to work the kinks out of her design.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Experimental Firearm ~ Experimental Gunsmith|PRECLASS:1,Gunslinger=1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Innovations ~ Experimental Gunsmith|PRECLASS:1,Gunslinger=1	COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.34

###Block: Gunslinger Archetype Abilities -------------------------
#Experimental Gunsmith
Experimental Firearm	KEY:Experimental Firearm ~ Experimental Gunsmith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, an Experimental Gunsmith begins play with an experimental firearm. This acts as the gunslinger's gunsmith ability, but the firearm the Experimental Gunsmith begins with has one innovation (see below). Further, the Experimental Gunsmith is treated as having the Gunsmithing feat, but only in regard to his beginning firearm (or the construction of a replacement firearm of the same design, if the original is lost). This ability otherwise works like the standard gunslinger's gunsmith and Gunsmithing abilities and replaces those abilities.	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
Innovations			KEY:Innovations ~ Experimental Gunsmith			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An Experimental Gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The Experimental Gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the Experimental Gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the Experimental Gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp).	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Experimental Gunsmith Innovation|(classlevel("Gunslinger")+3)/4

#Experimental Gunsmith - Innovations
Expanded Capacity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith increases her firearm's capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon's design). She also increases its weight by 50%%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).
Expanded Chamber	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the Experimental Gunsmith's square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.
Grapple Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the Experimental Gunsmith's firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%%.
Recoilless		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the Experimental Gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.
Vial Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist's fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The Experimental Gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her Experimental Gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the Experimental Gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.

Whenever she makes a Knowledge check of any kind about a question regarding elves (creatures of the elf subtype), the ancient lorekeeper adds half her class level on her check. This replaces the bonus skills the ancient lorekeeper gains from her mystery.
Elven Arcana	KEY:Elven Arcana ~ Ancient Lorekeeper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, an ancient lorekeeper's mastery of elven legends and philosophy has allowed her to master one spell used by elven wizards. She selects one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest-level oracle spell she can cast. The ancient lorekeeper gains this as a bonus spell known. The spell is treated as one level higher than its true level for all purposes. The ancient lorekeeper may choose an additional spell at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels.

Many elven magi do not consider themselves masters of a blend of martial and magical talents, but rather a sub-category of wizards who study the effect of physical movement and techniques upon spellcasting ability. They believe their ability to cast spells while fighting is an outgrowth of the concept of the "spell dance," which itself is just another kind of wizardry.

Spell Dance				KEY:Spell Dance ~ Spell Dancer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spell dancer gains the ability to expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to his movement rate and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through threatened spaces for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the spell dancer gains another +10 enhancement bonus to movement and +2 to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked from movement. At 5th level, once per spell dance as a swift action, the spell dancer may use one of the following on himself as a swift action: blur, fly, or haste. These abilities last for 1 round. At 9th level, the spell dancer may instead take a swift action to use dimension door as a spell-like ability once during a spelldance. At 13th level, the spell dancer may instead choose to take a swift action to gain freedom of movement for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces the magus's ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.

#
Spell Bond		KEY:Spell Bond ~ Spellbinder	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spellbinder selects any one spell that he knows as a bonded spell. As a full-round action, the spellbinder may replace a spell of the same or higher level as his bonded spell with his bonded spell. For example, a spellbinder who selects magic missile as his bonded spell could spend a full-round action to exchange any 1st-level or higher spell that he has prepared with magic missile. At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder may select another spell he knows and add it to his list of bonded spells, to a maximum of nine bonded spells at 17th level. Upon reaching 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder can choose to select a new spell as a bonded spell in place of one with which he is already bonded. In effect, the spellbinder loses the bond with the old spell (though it is still one of his spells known) in exchange for forging a spell bond with a new spell. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A spellbinder may swap only one spell bond at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell bond at the same time that he gains two new spells known for the level. This ability replaces arcane bond.

Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it's small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest's plants into combat. A treesinger has the following class features.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Plant Bond ~ Treesinger|PRECLASS:1,Druid=1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Green Empathy ~ Treesinger|PRECLASS:1,Druid=1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Wild Shape ~ Treesinger|PRECLASS:1,Druid=4
# TO DO: Requires the Selection for Plant Bond and the Choices
Plant Bond		KEY:Plant Bond ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger forms a mystic bond with plant life. This bond can take one of two forms. The first grants the treesinger one of the following domains: Plant (Core Rulebook); Growth (Advanced Player's Guide); Jungle, Swamp (Ultimate Magic). When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously. The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions (see page 26). This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid's animal companion ability. Plant bond replaces the druid's nature bond ability.
Green Empathy	KEY:Green Empathy ~ Treesinger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger can improve the attitude of a plant creature. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The treesinger rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the treesinger and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with inf luencing people, it might take more or less time. A treesinger can also use this ability to inf luence an animal, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.
Wild Shape		KEY:Wild Shape ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a treesinger gains the ability to wild shape. This ability functions at her actual druid level. A treesinger cannot use wild shape to adopt an animal or elemental form. Instead, when she gains this ability at 4th level, she can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant. This functions as plant shape I, except the treesinger does not yet gain access to the constrict or poison abilities of the plant form assumed. At 8th level, the treesinger's wild shape gains the full range of abilities available from plant shape I. At 10th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Large or Tiny plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape II. At 12th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Huge plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape III. This ability replaces, and otherwise functions like, the normal druid wild shape ability.
#Plant Companions
#Each plant companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions cannot gain armor or weapon proficiency feats, even as they advance in hit dice, and cannot use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise. As you gain levels, your plant companion grows in power as well. It gains the same bonuses that are gained by animal companions, noted on Table 3-8: Animal Companion Base Statistics on page 52 of the Core Rulebook. Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each plant choice. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Strength and Constitution by 2.

In addition to setting friends up for light-hearted pranks, the prankster can use his quick wit and cruel sense of humor to enrage foes before incapacitating them with a clever turn of phrase.

Bardic Performance	KEY:Bardic Performance ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A prankster's bardic performance functions like a bard's, but some of its performances are exchanged for those listed below.
Mock				KEY:Mock ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, the prankster can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him. Each creature to be mocked must be within 90 feet, able to see, hear, and understand the prankster, and capable of paying attention to him. The prankster must also be able to see the creatures affected. For every three levels the prankster has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the prankster's level + the prankster's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the prankster cannot successfully mock that creature for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm the prankster. While the prankster maintains the mocking, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully attacked the prankster with a melee or ranged attack, or has harmed the creature with a spell that deals damage. Mock is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. Mock relies on audible and visual components in order to function. This ability replaces fascinate.
Punchline			KEY:Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 6th level, the prankster can use his performance to tell a punchline to amuse a creature he has already mocked (see above), goading it into hideous laughter (as the spell). Using this ability does not disrupt the mock effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the mock effect). A prankster can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Telling a punchline does not count against a prankster's daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modif ier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Punchline is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language dependent ability and relies on audible components. This ability replaces the suggestion ability.
Mass Punchline		KEY:Mass Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:This ability functions just like punchline, but allows a prankster of 18th level or higher to use hideous laughter simultaneously against any number of creatures that he has mocked. This ability replaces the mass suggestion ability.
Swap				KEY:Swap ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A prankster can steal an object from a creature and replace it with another object of the same size or smaller that the prankster has in his hand. This functions as the steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322), but the prankster does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and may use his Sleight of Hand check in place of his combat maneuver check. If the prankster's check exceeds the target's CMD by 10 or more, the target is unaware the swap has been made until it tries to use the swapped object or the end of its next turn (whichever happens first). This ability replaces lore master.

Chameleon Mutagen			KEY:Chameleon Mutagen ~ Saboteur				CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a saboteur discovers how to create a special elixir that he can imbibe in order to heighten his ability to move undetected and his mobility at the cost of his physical might. When consumed, the elixir causes the saboteur's skin to change color to match the background and causes his hands and feet to secrete a sticky residue. This grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to half his alchemist level (minimum +1), as well as granting him a climb speed equal to half his base speed, for 10 minutes per saboteur level. In addition, while the chameleon extract is in effect, the saboteur takes a -2 penalty to his Strength. This ability replaces mutagen. A saboteur who drinks an alchemist's mutagen is treated as a non-alchemist. All limitations to mutagens apply to chameleon mutagen as if it were the same ability. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to the chameleon mutagen.
Saboteur Discoveries		KEY:Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur				CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following new options may be taken as discoveries by a saboteur. Bore Bomb*, Complex Bomb, Grand Chameleon Mutagen, Greater Chameleon Mutagen

Bore Bomb*				KEY:Discovery ~ Bore Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he may choose to make it a bore bomb. If a bore bomb strikes a wall, gate, siege engine, or similar large, solid, inanimate structure, it ignores half the target's hardness and deals 1 point of damage per saboteur level. If a bore bomb reduces an inanimate target to half its hit points or fewer, it blows a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the target.
Complex Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Complex Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he can choose to have it modif ied by two different discoveries that modify a bomb's damage (those discoveries marked with an asterisk). Each discovery modif ies half the bomb's damage dice, rounding down. For example, a concussive/frost bomb from a 9th-level saboteur deals 2d4 points of sonic damage + 2d6 points of frost damage. Creating a complex bomb counts as 2 daily uses of the bomb ability.

#
Bonded Item	KEY:Bonded Item ~ Bonded Witch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard's arcane bond bonded item (Core Rulebook 78), and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions. A bonded witch's bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way (Advanced Player's Guide 68), but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item. Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch's bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch's level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way. She can cast any one of these spells once per day using her bonded object, but gains greater f lexibility in what spells she can cast, and gains more powerful spells as she gains new levels.

Briar Bombs		KEY:Briar Bombs ~ Bramble Brewer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, a bramble brewer gains the tanglefoot bomb discovery (Ultimate Magic 17), but the entanglement's duration persists for a number of rounds equal to the bramble brewer's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 round). Additionally, when a bramble brewer throws a tanglefoot bomb, it transforms all squares in its splash radius into difficult terrain that persists for as long as the bomb's entangling effect. Although these bombs deal no damage, for every 1d6 points of damage the bramble brewer's regular bombs deal, the briar bomb's splash radius increases by 5 feet. This ability replaces the 2nd-level discovery class feature.
Dendrite Mutagen	KEY:Dendrite Mutagen ~ Bramble Brewer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a bramble brewer's mutagen still contains transformative power, but grants a treelike sturdiness rather than the feral power of standard mutagens. When imbibed, dendrite mutagen grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +2 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, and a -2 penalty to the corresponding mental ability score (as per the normal mutagen class feature; Advanced Player's Guide 28). In addition, the alchemist gains fast healing 1 as long as he is in an area of bright light (such as sunlight or inside the area of a daylight spell). This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the greater mutagen discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that still grants a +4 natural armor bonus, and also grants a +4 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score and a +2 bonus to a second physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, but his fast healing increases to 3 as long as he is in an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the greater mutagen discovery and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the grand mutagen discovery can brew a dendrite mutagen that now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +2 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's fast healing increases to 5 as long as he is within an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the grand mutagen discovery and replaces that ability.
Grand Discovery	KEY:Grand Discovery ~ Bramble Brewer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 20th level, a bramble brewer who selects the true mutagen grand discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that grants a +8 natural armor bonus and a +6 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's gains fast healing 10, but instead of only gaining fast healing in bright light, this fast healing persists in areas of bright or normal light. A bramble brewer must possess the grand mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.
Discoveries		KEY:Discoveries ~ Bramble Brewer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following discoveries complement the bramble brewer archetype: precise bombs (Advanced Player's Guide); defoliant bomb (Advanced Race Guide); lingering spirit, strafe bomb, sunlight bomb (Ultimate Magic).

Spells			KEY:Spells ~ Wild Caller	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wild caller does not have access to summon monster spells. Instead, he swaps out those spells on his spell list with summon nature's ally spells of the same level. This ability alters the normal spell list of the summoner.
Eidolon			KEY:Eidolon ~ Wild Caller	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The eidolon of a wild caller tends to take more natural and more savage forms than other summoners' eidolons. A wild caller gains 1/4 his class level as bonus evolution points in his eidolon's evolution pool, but his eidolon cannot take the following evolutions: Advanced Player's Guide-1-point evolutions: magic attacks, skilled (while the eidolon can select this evolution, it can only do so with the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Survival, and Swim); 2-point evolutions: energy attacks, immunity, weapon training; 3-point evolutions: damage reduction, frightful presence; 4-point evolutions: breath weapon, spell resistance.

Summon Nature's Ally I	KEY:Summon Nature's Ally I ~ Wild Caller	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a wild caller can cast summon nature's ally a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modif ier. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon nature's ally IX at 17th level). Furthermore, at 19th level, the wild caller cannot use gate as a spell-like ability, but can use either summon elder worm or summon froghemoth (Ultimate Magic 240) instead. This ability otherwise functions like the standard summoner's summon monster I ability and replaces that ability.

Such rangers stalk the wild like shadows, creating close bonds with the wild itself instead of seeking the solace and aid of companions. While ill at ease within cities and other urban areas, they are adept at using the terrain to tactical advantage; they dart through brambles and rough terrain with uncommon grace and use the land itself to lock down enemies.

Wild at Heart		KEY:Wild at Heart ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a wild shadow adds only 1/2 his class level when making wild empathy checks while in urban areas, and adds only 1/4 his class level to follow or identify tracks in such areas. In non-urban settings, he is considered two levels higher when determining the bonuses for such checks. This ability alters the track and wild empathy class features.
Favored Terrain		KEY:Favored Terrain ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, when a wild shadow chooses a favored terrain, he cannot choose urban as the terrain type. Furthermore, at 8th level and every five levels thereafter, when he chooses a new favorite terrain type, he cannot choose the urban terrain type. This ability alters the favored terrain class feature.
Woodland Stride		KEY:Woodland Stride ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:This ability functions as the 7th level ranger class feature of the same name, but the wild shadow gains it at 4th level instead.

Unfettered Step		KEY:Unfettered Step ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, a wild shadow's woodland stride class feature functions in any difficult terrain within any of his favored terrains, even in areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion. This ability replaces the ranger's woodland stride class feature gained at 7th level.
Harrying Attack		KEY:Harrying Attack ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level, a wild shadow can use his knowledge of terrain to make shrewd attacks in combat. Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow's favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.
Wild Stalker		KEY:Wild Stalker ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 14th level, a wild shadow learns to better use natural surroundings to obscure his position in combat. Whenever a wild shadow is within one of his favored terrains and a feature of that terrain grants him cover, the bonuses to AC and Ref lex saves for that cover improve by 1. Additionally, while he is within one of his favored terrains, if he gains concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of either type of concealment improves by 10%. Furthermore, at 16th level and 19th level, the bonuses granted by cover increase by 1 and the miss chance increases by another 10% (maximum +3 and +30% respectively at 20th level). This ability replaces the camouflage class feature.
Master of Terrain		KEY:Master of Terrain ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 19th level, a wild shadow can use his harrying attack against creatures other than his favored enemy or he can spend a standard action to designate up to two of his favored enemies as his harried prey instead.

Blood Feast		KEY:Blood Feast ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has. At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer. This ability replaces the summon monster I, III, V, VII, and IX spell-like abilities.
Bloody Gift		KEY:Bloody Gift ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.
Avatar Gambit	KEY:Avatar Gambit ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.
Rage Power		KEY:Rage Power ~ Blood God Disciple		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level and 15th level, a blood god disciple selects a barbarian rage power, which he may use when raging (whether from the avatar gambit ability or actual barbarian rage).

While some hide their shame, others foster a deep, burning hatred that they channel into a raw fury and unleash against their enemies. These half-orcs are called hateful ragers.

Favored Enemy	KEY:Favored Enemy ~ Hateful Rager		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a hateful rager selects a favored enemy. This ability works identically to the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the hateful rager selects another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type, as described in the ranger class. While raging, the hateful rager makes every effort to fight a favored enemy rather than other opponents. If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way). She can avoid harmful obstacles normally in her attempts to reach the target and is not forced to take the shortest route. This ability replaces the barbarian's rage power gained at 2nd level. At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, in place of a rage power she gains another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type.
Feed the Rage	KEY:Feed the Rage ~ Hateful Rager		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 5th level, a hateful rager gains 1 additional round of rage for each favored enemy she knocks unconscious or kills in combat.

Some half-orc paladins take up these misunderstood creatures as their cause, standing up for the monstrous creatures and, when possible, leading them to the light. These paladins are called redeemers. A redeemer has the following class features.

She does not take the normal -4 attack roll penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. She cannot use this ability to deal nonlethal damage to outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, or undead creatures (these creatures take lethal damage from her smite). This otherwise works like and replaces the standard paladin's smite evil.
Monstrous Rapport	KEY:Monstrous Rapport ~ Redeemer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, redeemers gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to inf luence creatures who are commonly considered monstrous.

Her caster level for this ability is equal to her paladin level. Rather than assigning a mission or task, the redeemer gives the creature a simple set of prohibitions to protect others. Example geas include "Leave this city and do not return" or "Do not attack caravans." The prohibition must be against an area no larger than 300 square miles or one specific group of people (such as a tribe or citizens of a particular city). This ability lasts 1 month per paladin level. This replaces aura of resolve.

Quicker than the Eye	KEY:Quicker than the Eye ~ Filcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a filcher develops an amazingly swift and delicate touch. When she uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher's class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal -20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.
Rummage			KEY:Rummage ~ Filcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a filcher learns how to assess the value of items at the quickest glance. She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers. She gains a +1 bonus on Appraise checks and an additional +1 bonus every three levels thereafter. As a swift action, a filcher can make an Appraise check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of ). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a -20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see. This ability replaces trap sense +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6.
Filch				KEY:Filch ~ Filcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 4th level, a filcher learns how pluck items off her opponents even in combat. She gains Improved Steal (Advanced Player's Guide 163) as a bonus feat and can use her Sleight of Hand bonus instead of her CMB when performing a steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322). If the filcher gains bonuses on combat maneuver checks from any feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, they are added to the Sleight of Hand bonus when using the steal maneuver. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
Superior Filching		KEY:Superior Filching ~ Filcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 8th level, a filcher becomes a master at separating owners from their property.
