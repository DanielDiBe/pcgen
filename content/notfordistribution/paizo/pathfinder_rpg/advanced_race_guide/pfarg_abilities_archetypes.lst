# Exarch Abilities:
Spells			KEY:Spells ~ Exarch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:Exarchs cannot cast spells with the chaotic descriptor.
Inflexible Will		KEY:Inflexible Will ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, an exarch gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against confusion and insanity effects and effects with the chaotic descriptor.

Fearsome Jurist		KEY:Fearsome Jurist ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, an exarch can imbue one of her weapons with the jurist or menacing weapon special ability as a swift action, and may switch between these properties as a swift action. When using either special ability, her weapon's critical threat range doubles against chaotic creatures. This does not stack with keen edge, Improved Critical, or similar effects. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces bane.
Aura of Repetition	KEY:Aura of Repetition ~ Exarch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, once per day while using her judgment, an exarch can project an aura of repetition, as the Toil subdomain power (Advanced Player's Guide 97). If the exarch takes Artifice (Toil) as her domain, the save DC of her aura increases by 2 but its duration does not increase. This ability replaces her second judgment.
Double Jeopardy		KEY:Double Jeopardy ~ Exarch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 12th level, whenever an exarch uses her fearsome jurist ability, she may choose to affect two weapons, with one gaining the jurist weapon special ability and the other the menacing special ability as above. Both special abilities may be combined in a single weapon, whose critical threat range doubles. This does not stack with keen edge, Improved Critical, or similar effects. This ability replaces greater bane.
Aura of Reversion		KEY:Aura of Reversion ~ Exarch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 16th level, while using her judgment, an exarch can project a 30-foot-radius emanation for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. Any creature other than the exarch that is using a transmutation effect within this aura at the beginning of its turn becomes sickened, or sickened and nauseated if using a polymorph effect, including the change shape ability (Fortitude negates; DC 10 + 1/2 the exarch's level + her Wisdom modifier). Continuous effects from permanent magical items do not cause this effect. Within the aura, dispel checks against transmutation effects gain a +4 bonus. This ability cannot be used simultaneously with aura of repetition. This ability replaces her third judgment.

Foehammer (Fighter)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]

Hammer to the Ground (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, when a foehammer succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver, he can make a trip combat maneuver at the end of the bull rush. If he does not move with the target, the force of his blow may still trip his foe, but he takes a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check to trip. At 15th level, any creature a foehammer successfully bull rushes is automatically knocked prone at the end of the bull rush. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 4.
Rhythmic Blows (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, each time that a foehammer hits a target, he gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls against that target. This bonus stacks with each hit against that target, but lasts only until the end of the foehammer's turn. This ability replaces weapon training 2.
Piledriver (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 11th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group. If the attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces armor training 3.
Ground Breaker (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 13th level, as a full-round action, a foehammer may strike the ground with his hammer. If the attack deals more damage than the f loor's hardness, the space he occupies and all adjacent squares become difficult terrain. Creatures in those squares, except for the foehammer, are knocked prone (DC 15 Ref lex negates). This ability replaces weapon training 3.
Hammer Master (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 17th level, any combat feats a foehammer has learned with any weapon from the hammer weapon training group (e.g., Improved Critical, Weapon Focus) apply to all weapons from that group. This ability replaces weapon training 4.
Devastating Blow (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 19th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group at a -5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical threat. Weapon special abilities that only activate on a critical hit do not activate if this critical hit is confirmed. This ability replaces armor mastery.

If the spell has one or more metamagic feats applied, she reduces the total level adjustment to the spell by 1 (minimum 0).
Runeforger (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A forgemaster may inscribe mystical runes upon a suit of armor, shield, or weapon as full-round action, using this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. These runes last 1 round per cleric level, but inscribing the same rune twice on an item increases this duration to 1 minute per level, three times to 10 minutes per level, and four times to 1 hour per level. Erase affects runes as magical writing. A forgemaster learns forgemaster's blessing at 1st level and may learn one additional rune at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter.

	DESC:A stonelord is a devoted sentinel of dwarven enclaves, drawing the power of the earth and ancient stone to protect her people.
Stonestrike (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day per paladin level, a stonelord can draw upon the power of the living rock. As a swift action, she treats her melee attacks until the beginning of her next turn (whether armed or unarmed) as magical and adamantine, including ignoring hardness up to twice her paladin level, with a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls, as well as on combat maneuver checks. This bonus also applies to her CMD if she or her target is touching the ground or a stone structure. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This ability replaces smite evil.
Heartstone (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, a stonelord's f lesh becomes progressively rockier. She gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC and DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 her paladin level.

A stonelord does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items.
Earth Channel (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a stonelord gains Elemental Channel (earth) as a bonus feat, which she may activate by spending two uses of her lay on hands ability, using her paladin level as her effective cleric level.

By spending 2 uses of her stonestrike ability, she may ignore any cover less than total cover provided by stone or metal, and she ignores any AC bonus from stone or metal armor or shields as if wielding a brilliant energy weapon. A phase strike cannot damage constructs, objects, or creatures with the earth subtype, but unlike a brilliant energy weapon, it can harm undead. This ability replaces her 12th-level mercy.

Ancient Lorekeeper (Oracle)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:The ancient lorekeeper is a repository for all the beliefs and vast knowledge of an elven people. She shows a strong interest in and understanding of histories and creation legends at a young age, and as she matures her calling to serve as the memory of her long-lived people becomes clear to all who know her. An ancient lorekeeper has the following class features.
Class Skills	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An ancient lorekeeper adds Knowledge (arcane) and Knowledge (local) to her list of class skills. Whenever she makes a Knowledge check of any kind about a question regarding elves (creatures of the elf subtype), the ancient lorekeeper adds half her class level on her check. This replaces the bonus skills the ancient lorekeeper gains from her mystery.
Elven Arcana (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, an ancient lorekeeper's mastery of elven legends and philosophy has allowed her to master one spell used by elven wizards. She selects one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest-level oracle spell she can cast. The ancient lorekeeper gains this as a bonus spell known. The spell is treated as one level higher than its true level for all purposes. The ancient lorekeeper may choose an additional spell at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels. This ability replaces the bonus spells she would normally gain at these levels from her chosen mystery.
Mysteries	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following oracle mysteries complement the ancient lorekeeper archetype: Lore, Nature, Waves, Wind (Advanced Player's Guide); Ancestor, Time, Wood (Ultimate Magic).

Spell Dancer (Magus)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:The strong emphasis on wizards within elven culture inf luences how even non-wizard elves see themselves. Many elven magi do not consider themselves masters of a blend of martial and magical talents, but rather a sub-category of wizards who study the effect of physical movement and techniques upon spellcasting ability. They believe their ability to cast spells while fighting is an outgrowth of the concept of the "spell dance," which itself is just another kind of wizardry. A spell dancer has the following class features.
Class Skills	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spell dancer adds Acrobatics and Perform (dance) to his list of class skills and removes Intimidate and Ride from his list of class skills.
Spell Dance (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a spell dancer gains the ability to expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to his movement rate and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through threatened spaces for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the spell dancer gains another +10 enhancement bonus to movement and +2 to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked from movement. At 5th level, once per spell dance as a swift action, the spell dancer may use one of the following on himself as a swift action: blur, fly, or haste. These abilities last for 1 round. At 9th level, the spell dancer may instead take a swift action to use dimension door as a spell-like ability once during a spelldance. At 13th level, the spell dancer may instead choose to take a swift action to gain freedom of movement for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces the magus's ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.
Arcane Movement (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, whenever a spell dancer casts a magus spell, he gains a competence bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, and Stealth checks equal to the spell's level until the beginning of his next turn. This ability replaces the bonus feat a magus receives at 5th level.
Dance of Avoidance (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer gains a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class. This ability replaces the medium armor class feature.
Greater Dance of Avoidance (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 13th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer's insight bonus to Armor Class increases to +4. This ability replaces the heavy armor class feature.

This ability replaces the magus's ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.

Magus Arcana	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following magus arcana complement the spell dancer archetype: arcane cloak, prescient defense (Ultimate Combat); close range, concentrate, hasted assault, spell shield (Ultimate Magic).

Spellbinder (Wizard)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:A spellbinder is an elven wizard who forges an arcane bond between himself and one or more wizard spells. These spells become so well understood by the spellbinder that he can prepare them in spell slots that already have other spells prepared in them.
Spell Bond (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a spellbinder selects any one spell that he knows as a bonded spell. As a full-round action, the spellbinder may replace a spell of the same or higher level as his bonded spell with his bonded spell. For example, a spellbinder who selects magic missile as his bonded spell could spend a full-round action to exchange any 1st-level or higher spell that he has prepared with magic missile. At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder may select another spell he knows and add it to his list of bonded spells, to a maximum of nine bonded spells at 17th level. Upon reaching 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder can choose to select a new spell as a bonded spell in place of one with which he is already bonded. In effect, the spellbinder loses the bond with the old spell (though it is still one of his spells known) in exchange for forging a spell bond with a new spell. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A spellbinder may swap only one spell bond at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell bond at the same time that he gains two new spells known for the level. This ability replaces arcane bond.
Discoveries	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following discoveries complement the spellbinder archetype: Fast Study, Split Slot (Ultimate Magic).
This ability replaces arcane bond.

Treesinger (Druid)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:Elves live far longer than other common races, and a single elf may see whole empires rise and fall. Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it's small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest's plants into combat. A treesinger has the following class features.
Plant Bond (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger forms a mystic bond with plant life. This bond can take one of two forms. The first grants the treesinger one of the following domains: Plant (Core Rulebook); Growth (Advanced Player's Guide); Jungle, Swamp (Ultimate Magic). When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously. The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions (see page 26). This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid's animal companion ability. Plant bond replaces the druid's nature bond ability.
Green Empathy (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger can improve the attitude of a plant creature. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The treesinger rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the treesinger and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with inf luencing people, it might take more or less time. A treesinger can also use this ability to inf luence an animal, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.
Wild Shape (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a treesinger gains the ability to wild shape. This ability functions at her actual druid level. A treesinger cannot use wild shape to adopt an animal or elemental form. Instead, when she gains this ability at 4th level, she can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant. This functions as plant shape I, except the treesinger does not yet gain access to the constrict or poison abilities of the plant form assumed. At 8th level, the treesinger's wild shape gains the full range of abilities available from plant shape I. At 10th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Large or Tiny plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape II. At 12th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Huge plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape III. This ability replaces, and otherwise functions like, the normal druid wild shape ability.

Plant bond replaces the druid's nature bond ability.
This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.
This ability replaces, and otherwise functions like, the normal druid wild shape ability.

Plant Companions
Each plant companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions cannot gain armor or weapon proficiency feats, even as they advance in hit dice, and cannot use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise. As you gain levels, your plant companion grows in power as well. It gains the same bonuses that are gained by animal companions, noted on Table 3-8: Animal Companion Base Statistics on page 52 of the Core Rulebook. Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each plant choice. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Strength and Constitution by 2.

#Experimental Gunsmith
Experimental Firearm	KEY:Experimental Firearm ~ Experimental Gunsmith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, an Experimental Gunsmith begins play with an experimental firearm. This acts as the gunslinger's gunsmith ability, but the firearm the Experimental Gunsmith begins with has one innovation (see below). Further, the Experimental Gunsmith is treated as having the Gunsmithing feat, but only in regard to his beginning firearm (or the construction of a replacement firearm of the same design, if the original is lost). This ability otherwise works like the standard gunslinger's gunsmith and Gunsmithing abilities and replaces those abilities.	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
Innovations			KEY:Innovations ~ Experimental Gunsmith			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An Experimental Gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The Experimental Gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the Experimental Gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the Experimental Gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp).

#Experimental Gunsmith - Innovations
Expanded Capacity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith increases her firearm's capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon's design). She also increases its weight by 50%%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).
Expanded Chamber	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the Experimental Gunsmith's square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.
Grapple Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the Experimental Gunsmith's firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%%.
Recoilless		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the Experimental Gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.
Vial Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist's fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The Experimental Gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her Experimental Gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the Experimental Gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.

Prankster (Bard)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:The prankster sees humor as the highest form or art, and pranks as the highest form of humor. In addition to setting friends up for light-hearted pranks, the prankster can use his quick wit and cruel sense of humor to enrage foes before incapacitating them with a clever turn of phrase.
Bardic Performance	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A prankster's bardic performance functions like a bard's, but some of its performances are exchanged for those listed below.
Mock (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, the prankster can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him. Each creature to be mocked must be within 90 feet, able to see, hear, and understand the prankster, and capable of paying attention to him. The prankster must also be able to see the creatures affected. For every three levels the prankster has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the prankster's level + the prankster's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the prankster cannot successfully mock that creature for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm the prankster. While the prankster maintains the mocking, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully attacked the prankster with a melee or ranged attack, or has harmed the creature with a spell that deals damage. Mock is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. Mock relies on audible and visual components in order to function. This ability replaces fascinate.
Punchline (Sp)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, the prankster can use his performance to tell a punchline to amuse a creature he has already mocked (see above), goading it into hideous laughter (as the spell). Using this ability does not disrupt the mock effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the mock effect). A prankster can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Telling a punchline does not count against a prankster's daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modif ier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Punchline is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language dependent ability and relies on audible components. This ability replaces the suggestion ability.
Mass Punchline (Sp)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:This ability functions just like punchline, but allows a prankster of 18th level or higher to use hideous laughter simultaneously against any number of creatures that he has mocked. This ability replaces the mass suggestion ability.
Swap (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A prankster can steal an object from a creature and replace it with another object of the same size or smaller that the prankster has in his hand. This functions as the steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322), but the prankster does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and may use his Sleight of Hand check in place of his combat maneuver check. If the prankster's check exceeds the target's CMD by 10 or more, the target is unaware the swap has been made until it tries to use the swapped object or the end of its next turn (whichever happens first). This ability replaces lore master.

Saboteur (Alchemist)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:The saboteur is an alchemist who specializes in destroying the plans, materials, and allies of his enemies. A saboteur has focused his alchemical research toward new ways to conceal his presence, sow confusion, and blow up large structures.
Class Skills	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A saboteur adds Knowledge (engineering) to his list of class skills and removes Knowledge (nature) from his list of class skills.
Chameleon Mutagen (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a saboteur discovers how to create a special elixir that he can imbibe in order to heighten his ability to move undetected and his mobility at the cost of his physical might. When consumed, the elixir causes the saboteur's skin to change color to match the background and causes his hands and feet to secrete a sticky residue. This grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to half his alchemist level (minimum +1), as well as granting him a climb speed equal to half his base speed, for 10 minutes per saboteur level. In addition, while the chameleon extract is in effect, the saboteur takes a -2 penalty to his Strength. This ability replaces mutagen. A saboteur who drinks an alchemist's mutagen is treated as a non-alchemist. All limitations to mutagens apply to chameleon mutagen as if it were the same ability. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to the chameleon mutagen.

Saboteur Discoveries	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following new options may be taken as discoveries by a saboteur.
Bore Bomb*	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he may choose to make it a bore bomb. If a bore bomb strikes a wall, gate, siege engine, or similar large, solid, inanimate structure, it ignores half the target's hardness and deals 1 point of damage per saboteur level. If a bore bomb reduces an inanimate target to half its hit points or fewer, it blows a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the target.
Complex Bomb	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he can choose to have it modif ied by two different discoveries that modify a bomb's damage (those discoveries marked with an asterisk). Each discovery modif ies half the bomb's damage dice, rounding down. For example, a concussive/frost bomb from a 9th-level saboteur deals 2d4 points of sonic damage + 2d6 points of frost damage. Creating a complex bomb counts as 2 daily uses of the bomb ability.
Grand Chameleon Mutagen	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The saboteur's chameleon mutagen now grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to his alchemist level, as well as granting him a climb speed equal to his normal movement speed. The saboteur must possess the greater chameleon mutagen discovery and be at least 16th level to select this discovery.
Greater Chameleon Mutagen	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The saboteur's chameleon mutagen now also grants the saboteur the hide in plain sight ability, as the ranger ability of the same name, but it functions in any terrain. The saboteur must be at least 12th level to select this discovery.
Grand Discoveries	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A saboteur may select the following grand discovery.
True Chameleon Mutagen	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The saboteur's chameleon mutagen now acts as if he was under the effects of the improved invisibility and spider climb spells, using his alchemist level as the caster level, for the duration of the mutagen. The saboteur must possess the grand chameleon mutagen discovery to select this grand discovery.
Discoveries	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following discoveries complement the saboteur archetype: acid bomb, concussive bomb, delayed bomb, explosive bomb, fast bombs, inferno bomb, madness bomb, precise bombs, smoke bomb, stink bomb (Advanced Player's Guide); explosive missile, immolation bomb, siege bomb (Ultimate Combat); blinding bomb, cognatogen, confusion bomb, tanglefoot bomb (Ultimate Magic).

Bonded Witch (Witch)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:While all witches commune with the unknown, the blend of human ingenuity and adept learning mixed with elven blood gives some half-elves a unique conduit to channel the powers of the arcane. Bonded witches forsake familiars as vessels of power in favor of a specific object that grants them powers above and beyond those of their patron alone, as they tap into the powerful magic of the item itself. A bonded witch has the following class features.
Bonded Item (Sp)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard's arcane bond bonded item (Core Rulebook 78), and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions. A bonded witch's bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way (Advanced Player's Guide 68), but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item. Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch's bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch's level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way. She can cast any one of these spells once per day using her bonded object, but gains greater f lexibility in what spells she can cast, and gains more powerful spells as she gains new levels. The bonded item spells associated with each item type are as follows.

Bramble Brewer (Alchemist)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:Some half-elven alchemists merge human curiosity with their elven link to nature. Such alchemists can manipulate the forces of alchemy to create bombs that reshape terrain and defoliate swaths of vegetation or to create mutagens that bestow the resilience of oak or the tenacity of bamboo. A bramble brewer has the following class features.
Briar Bombs (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, a bramble brewer gains the tanglefoot bomb discovery (Ultimate Magic 17), but the entanglement's duration persists for a number of rounds equal to the bramble brewer's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 round). Additionally, when a bramble brewer throws a tanglefoot bomb, it transforms all squares in its splash radius into difficult terrain that persists for as long as the bomb's entangling effect. Although these bombs deal no damage, for every 1d6 points of damage the bramble brewer's regular bombs deal, the briar bomb's splash radius increases by 5 feet. This ability replaces the 2nd-level discovery class feature.
Dendrite Mutagen (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a bramble brewer's mutagen still contains transformative power, but grants a treelike sturdiness rather than the feral power of standard mutagens. When imbibed, dendrite mutagen grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +2 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, and a -2 penalty to the corresponding mental ability score (as per the normal mutagen class feature; Advanced Player's Guide 28). In addition, the alchemist gains fast healing 1 as long as he is in an area of bright light (such as sunlight or inside the area of a daylight spell). This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the greater mutagen discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that still grants a +4 natural armor bonus, and also grants a +4 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score and a +2 bonus to a second physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, but his fast healing increases to 3 as long as he is in an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the greater mutagen discovery and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the grand mutagen discovery can brew a dendrite mutagen that now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +2 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's fast healing increases to 5 as long as he is within an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the grand mutagen discovery and replaces that ability.
Grand Discovery (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, a bramble brewer who selects the true mutagen grand discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that grants a +8 natural armor bonus and a +6 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's gains fast healing 10, but instead of only gaining fast healing in bright light, this fast healing persists in areas of bright or normal light. A bramble brewer must possess the grand mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.
Discoveries	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following discoveries complement the bramble brewer archetype: precise bombs (Advanced Player's Guide); defoliant bomb (Advanced Race Guide); lingering spirit, strafe bomb, sunlight bomb (Ultimate Magic).

Wild Caller (Summoner)	KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
	DESC:Often a half-elf 's ties to nature and elven heritage are so strong that they can dramatically affect the nature of his summonings. The wild caller calls eidolons that take more natural and savage forms and summons from nature rather than the Great Beyond. A wild caller has the following class features.
Spells	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wild caller does not have access to summon monster spells. Instead, he swaps out those spells on his spell list with summon nature's ally spells of the same level. This ability alters the normal spell list of the summoner.
#45
Eidolon	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The eidolon of a wild caller tends to take more natural and more savage forms than other summoners' eidolons. A wild caller gains 1/4 his class level as bonus evolution points in his eidolon's evolution pool, but his eidolon cannot take the following evolutions: Advanced Player's Guide-1-point evolutions: magic attacks, skilled (while the eidolon can select this evolution, it can only do so with the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Survival, and Swim); 2-point evolutions: energy attacks, immunity, weapon training; 3-point evolutions: damage reduction, frightful presence; 4-point evolutions: breath weapon, spell resistance. Ultimate Magic-1-point evolutions: basic magic, unnatural aura; 2-point evolutions: channel resistance, head, minor magic, undead appearance; 3-point evolutions: major magic; 4-point evolutions: dimension door, incorporeal form, lifesense, no breath, ultimate magic. This ability alters the normal summoner's eidolon class feature, but is otherwise identical to that class feature.
Summon Nature's Ally I (Sp)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a wild caller can cast summon nature's ally a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modif ier. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon nature's ally IX at 17th level). Furthermore, at 19th level, the wild caller cannot use gate as a spell-like ability, but can use either summon elder worm or summon froghemoth (Ultimate Magic 240) instead. This ability otherwise functions like the standard summoner's summon monster I ability and replaces that ability.

	DESC:The isolation that some half-elves feel leads them to live a life of isolation amid the wild places of the world. Such rangers stalk the wild like shadows, creating close bonds with the wild itself instead of seeking the solace and aid of companions. While ill at ease within cities and other urban areas, they are adept at using the terrain to tactical advantage; they dart through brambles and rough terrain with uncommon grace and use the land itself to lock down enemies. A wild shadow has the following class features.
Wild at Heart (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a wild shadow adds only 1/2 his class level when making wild empathy checks while in urban areas, and adds only 1/4 his class level to follow or identify tracks in such areas. In non-urban settings, he is considered two levels higher when determining the bonuses for such checks. This ability alters the track and wild empathy class features.
Favored Terrain (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, when a wild shadow chooses a favored terrain, he cannot choose urban as the terrain type. Furthermore, at 8th level and every five levels thereafter, when he chooses a new favorite terrain type, he cannot choose the urban terrain type. This ability alters the favored terrain class feature.
Woodland Stride (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:This ability functions as the 7th level ranger class feature of the same name, but the wild shadow gains it at 4th level instead. This ability replaces the hunter's bond class feature.
Unfettered Step (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, a wild shadow's woodland stride class feature functions in any difficult terrain within any of his favored terrains, even in areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion.

TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 11th level, a wild shadow can use his knowledge of terrain to make shrewd attacks in combat. Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow's favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.
Wild Stalker (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 14th level, a wild shadow learns to better use natural surroundings to obscure his position in combat. Whenever a wild shadow is within one of his favored terrains and a feature of that terrain grants him cover, the bonuses to AC and Ref lex saves for that cover improve by 1. Additionally, while he is within one of his favored terrains, if he gains concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of either type of concealment improves by 10%. Furthermore, at 16th level and 19th level, the bonuses granted by cover increase by 1 and the miss chance increases by another 10% (maximum +3 and +30% respectively at 20th level). This ability replaces the camouflage class feature.

	DESC:A half-orc summoner who devotes himself to one of the bloody orc gods may believe his eidolon is an avatar of that god rather than a mere supernatural creature. A blood god disciple generally fights by the avatar's side and offers it blood sacrifices in exchange for martial prowess. A blood god disciple has the following class features.
Blood Feast (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has. At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer. This ability replaces the summon monster I, III, V, VII, and IX spell-like abilities.

Bloody Gift (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.
Avatar Gambit (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.
Rage Power (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.

	DESC:From a young age, many half-orcs are treated cruelly, bullied, ridiculed, and made outcasts. While some hide their shame, others foster a deep, burning hatred that they channel into a raw fury and unleash against their enemies. These half-orcs are called hateful ragers. A hateful rager has the following class features.
Reduced Rage (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and every level thereafter, a hateful rager only gains 1 additional round of rage per day instead of the normal 2 additional rounds of rage per day.
Favored Enemy (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, a hateful rager selects a favored enemy. This ability works identically to the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the hateful rager selects another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type, as described in the ranger class. While raging, the hateful rager makes every effort to fight a favored enemy rather than other opponents. If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way). She can avoid harmful obstacles normally in her attempts to reach the target and is not forced to take the shortest route. This ability replaces the barbarian's rage power gained at 2nd level. At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, in place of a rage power she gains another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type.
#55 
Feed the Rage (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, a hateful rager gains 1 additional round of rage for each favored enemy she knocks unconscious or kills in combat.

	DESC:As most half-orcs are outcasts, a half-orc paladin recognizes that often those who are monstrous are not necessarily evil and that sometimes even those who are evil became that way because of circumstances and misfortune. Some half-orc paladins take up these misunderstood creatures as their cause, standing up for the monstrous creatures and, when possible, leading them to the light. These paladins are called redeemers. A redeemer has the following class features.
Merciful Smite (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, when a redeemer chooses to smite a creature, she can have all of her attacks against the target deal nonlethal damage. She does not take the normal -4 attack roll penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. She cannot use this ability to deal nonlethal damage to outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, or undead creatures (these creatures take lethal damage from her smite). This otherwise works like and replaces the standard paladin's smite evil.
Monstrous Rapport (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, redeemers gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to inf luence creatures who are commonly considered monstrous. This includes but is not limited to "monstrous" races such as goblins and orcs, monstrous humanoids, and other intelligent nonhumanoid monsters. This ability replaces detect evil.
Pact of Peace (Sp)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level, a redeemer can force a defeated creature to accept a binding pact of peace as a condition of its surrender, as if using lesser geas. Her caster level for this ability is equal to her paladin level. Rather than assigning a mission or task, the redeemer gives the creature a simple set of prohibitions to protect others. Example geas include "Leave this city and do not return" or "Do not attack caravans." The prohibition must be against an area no larger than 300 square miles or one specific group of people (such as a tribe or citizens of a particular city). This ability lasts 1 month per paladin level. This replaces aura of resolve.
Aura of Mercy (Su)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 11th level, a redeemer can expend two uses of her merciful smite ability to grant the merciful smite ability to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this merciful smite ability by the start of the paladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benef it from this ability. This replaces aura of justice.
Associates	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A redeemer may ally with an evil creature as long as she feels the creature is capable of redemption. A redeemer may accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are not lawful good provided they demonstrate they are willing to follow her and seek betterment under her tutelage.

	DESC:Pushed into a life of crime by the society around them, half orcs gravitate toward criminal activities that suit them best. Half-orc rogues leave subtle tactics and finesse to half lings and elves, and rely on brute strength and thuggery when they go about making mischief. Skulking slayers have turned the use of raw strength and surprise into an art form. A skulking slayer has the following class features.

Quicker than the Eye (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, a filcher develops an amazingly swift and delicate touch. When she uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher's class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal -20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.
Rummage (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, a filcher learns how to assess the value of items at the quickest glance. She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers.

As a swift action, a filcher can make an Appraise check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of ). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a -20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see. This ability replaces trap sense +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6.

Liquid Courage (Ex)	KEY:	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, a buccaneer gains the ability to fortify her grit with strong drink.

The buccaneer can gain a maximum number of grog points each day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and they last for 1 hour or until used, whichever comes first. She gains a morale bonus on saves against fear and a dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity equal to her current grog point total. This ability replaces the nimble ability.
