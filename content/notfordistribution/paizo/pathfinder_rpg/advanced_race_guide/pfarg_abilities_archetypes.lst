Aura of Repetition	KEY:Aura of Repetition ~ Exarch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, once per day while using her judgment, an exarch can project an aura of repetition, as the Toil subdomain power (Advanced Player's Guide 97).

This bonus stacks with each hit against that target, but lasts only until the end of the foehammer's turn. This ability replaces weapon training 2.
Piledriver			KEY:Piledriver ~ Foehammer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group. If the attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces armor training 3.
Ground Breaker		KEY:Ground Breaker ~ Foehammer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 13th level, as a full-round action, a foehammer may strike the ground with his hammer.

###Block: Gunslinger Archetype Abilities -------------------------
#Experimental Gunsmith
Experimental Firearm	KEY:Experimental Firearm ~ Experimental Gunsmith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, an Experimental Gunsmith begins play with an experimental firearm. This acts as the gunslinger's gunsmith ability, but the firearm the Experimental Gunsmith begins with has one innovation (see below). Further, the Experimental Gunsmith is treated as having the Gunsmithing feat, but only in regard to his beginning firearm (or the construction of a replacement firearm of the same design, if the original is lost). This ability otherwise works like the standard gunslinger's gunsmith and Gunsmithing abilities and replaces those abilities.	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
Innovations			KEY:Innovations ~ Experimental Gunsmith			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An Experimental Gunsmith starts play with one innovation she can make to her experimental firearms, selected from the list below. This innovation is a radical change to the typical design of a firearm, and comes with both additional benefits and noteworthy drawbacks. The Experimental Gunsmith can maintain only one experimental firearm modified with one or more innovations, as it requires constant adjustments and much of her time is spent maintaining the weapon. If the Experimental Gunsmith takes the Gunsmithing feat, she can create other firearms using a single innovation she knows (or add one innovation to an existing firearm), though such weapons become unreliable over time. The misfire value of such weapons increases by 1 for each week after its creation, although the Experimental Gunsmith can return the misfire rate to normal by spending 1 day maintaining the weapon and spending 50 gp in raw materials. For the purposes of crafting such firearms, each innovation is treated as the masterwork weapon quality (with a value of 300 gp).	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Experimental Gunsmith Innovation|(classlevel("Gunslinger")+3)/4

#Experimental Gunsmith - Innovations
Expanded Capacity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith increases her firearm's capacity by one (generally by adding another barrel, depending on the weapon's design). She also increases its weight by 50%%. Because of the complexity of increasing its capacity, her weapon is more prone to misfire, and its misfire value increases by 1 (this is in addition to any misfire increase if the weapon is made with the Gunsmithing feat).
Expanded Chamber	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm has a much larger than normal chamber for black powder, allowing her to use 2 doses of powder with each shot. The weapon grants a +1 circumstance bonus on damage rolls. However, when the weapon misfires, it causes a flashburn. This is the same as the weapon exploding (dealing damage from a corner of the Experimental Gunsmith's square), except the weapon is not automatically destroyed. If a broken weapon misfires, it is destroyed as normal.
Grapple Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a special set of rails that allows her to slide a grappling hook over the barrel and fire it as a full-round action. The grappling hook anchors into anything she successfully hits with an attack roll, and the DC of the Strength check required to pull the grappling hook loose is equal to her attack roll to lodge it in place. A Disable Device check can remove it with a +5 bonus on the check, and a creature struck by the hook can escape it with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check with a +5 bonus on the check. The firearm is powerful enough to fire a hook trailing up to 100 feet of rope, but throws off the balance of the Experimental Gunsmith's firearm, reducing its range increment by 50%%.
Recoilless		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith's firearm includes a series of gears, springs, and pistons designed to reduce its recoil and thus improve accuracy. The range increment of the weapon increases by 10 feet. However, the system is fragile, and easily damaged. Anytime the weapon misfires, this system becomes broken and does not function until the Experimental Gunsmith spends 1 hour repairing it.
Vial Launcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ExperimentalGunsmithInnovation	DESC:The Experimental Gunsmith adds a special tube onto her firearm that can hold 1 vial of alchemical material, such as alchemist's fire, a tanglefoot bag, or a thunderstone. A special trigger allows her to channel the force of black powder into this tube to launch the vial as a ranged attack with half the range increment of her firearm. The Experimental Gunsmith can take this action in place of any single ranged attack, and may use the same attack bonus that she can apply to the firearm. If the alchemical substance has a save DC, it becomes 10 + 1/2 her Experimental Gunsmith level + her Wisdom modifier when she launches the vial from her firearm. This increase only applies to the initial saving throw. If additional saving throws are called for, they are resolved as normal. Reloading the tube is a time-consuming process and requires two full-round actions. If the weapon misfires while loaded with an alchemical substance, it detonates with the Experimental Gunsmith (and the firearm) as the target.

Whenever she makes a Knowledge check of any kind about a question regarding elves (creatures of the elf subtype), the ancient lorekeeper adds half her class level on her check. This replaces the bonus skills the ancient lorekeeper gains from her mystery.
Elven Arcana	KEY:Elven Arcana ~ Ancient Lorekeeper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, an ancient lorekeeper's mastery of elven legends and philosophy has allowed her to master one spell used by elven wizards. She selects one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest-level oracle spell she can cast. The ancient lorekeeper gains this as a bonus spell known. The spell is treated as one level higher than its true level for all purposes. The ancient lorekeeper may choose an additional spell at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels.

Many elven magi do not consider themselves masters of a blend of martial and magical talents, but rather a sub-category of wizards who study the effect of physical movement and techniques upon spellcasting ability. They believe their ability to cast spells while fighting is an outgrowth of the concept of the "spell dance," which itself is just another kind of wizardry.

Spell Dance				KEY:Spell Dance ~ Spell Dancer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spell dancer gains the ability to expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to his movement rate and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through threatened spaces for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the spell dancer gains another +10 enhancement bonus to movement and +2 to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked from movement. At 5th level, once per spell dance as a swift action, the spell dancer may use one of the following on himself as a swift action: blur, fly, or haste. These abilities last for 1 round. At 9th level, the spell dancer may instead take a swift action to use dimension door as a spell-like ability once during a spelldance. At 13th level, the spell dancer may instead choose to take a swift action to gain freedom of movement for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces the magus's ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.

#
Spell Bond		KEY:Spell Bond ~ Spellbinder	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spellbinder selects any one spell that he knows as a bonded spell. As a full-round action, the spellbinder may replace a spell of the same or higher level as his bonded spell with his bonded spell. For example, a spellbinder who selects magic missile as his bonded spell could spend a full-round action to exchange any 1st-level or higher spell that he has prepared with magic missile. At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder may select another spell he knows and add it to his list of bonded spells, to a maximum of nine bonded spells at 17th level. Upon reaching 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder can choose to select a new spell as a bonded spell in place of one with which he is already bonded. In effect, the spellbinder loses the bond with the old spell (though it is still one of his spells known) in exchange for forging a spell bond with a new spell. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A spellbinder may swap only one spell bond at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell bond at the same time that he gains two new spells known for the level. This ability replaces arcane bond.

Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it's small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest's plants into combat. A treesinger has the following class features.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Plant Bond ~ Treesinger|PRECLASS:1,Druid=1		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Green Empathy ~ Treesinger|PRECLASS:1,Druid=1		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Wild Shape ~ Treesinger|PRECLASS:1,Druid=4
# TO DO: Requires the Selection for Plant Bond and the Choices
Plant Bond		KEY:Plant Bond ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger forms a mystic bond with plant life. This bond can take one of two forms. The first grants the treesinger one of the following domains: Plant (Core Rulebook); Growth (Advanced Player's Guide); Jungle, Swamp (Ultimate Magic). When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously. The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions (see page 26). This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid's animal companion ability. Plant bond replaces the druid's nature bond ability.
Green Empathy	KEY:Green Empathy ~ Treesinger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger can improve the attitude of a plant creature. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The treesinger rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the treesinger and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with inf luencing people, it might take more or less time. A treesinger can also use this ability to inf luence an animal, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.
Wild Shape		KEY:Wild Shape ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a treesinger gains the ability to wild shape. This ability functions at her actual druid level. A treesinger cannot use wild shape to adopt an animal or elemental form. Instead, when she gains this ability at 4th level, she can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant. This functions as plant shape I, except the treesinger does not yet gain access to the constrict or poison abilities of the plant form assumed. At 8th level, the treesinger's wild shape gains the full range of abilities available from plant shape I. At 10th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Large or Tiny plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape II. At 12th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Huge plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape III. This ability replaces, and otherwise functions like, the normal druid wild shape ability.
#Plant Companions
#Each plant companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions cannot gain armor or weapon proficiency feats, even as they advance in hit dice, and cannot use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise. As you gain levels, your plant companion grows in power as well. It gains the same bonuses that are gained by animal companions, noted on Table 3-8: Animal Companion Base Statistics on page 52 of the Core Rulebook. Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each plant choice. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Strength and Constitution by 2.

In addition to setting friends up for light-hearted pranks, the prankster can use his quick wit and cruel sense of humor to enrage foes before incapacitating them with a clever turn of phrase.

#
Bardic Performance	KEY:Bardic Performance ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A prankster's bardic performance functions like a bard's, but some of its performances are exchanged for those listed below.
Mock				KEY:Mock ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, the prankster can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him. Each creature to be mocked must be within 90 feet, able to see, hear, and understand the prankster, and capable of paying attention to him. The prankster must also be able to see the creatures affected. For every three levels the prankster has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the prankster's level + the prankster's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the prankster cannot successfully mock that creature for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm the prankster. While the prankster maintains the mocking, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully attacked the prankster with a melee or ranged attack, or has harmed the creature with a spell that deals damage. Mock is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. Mock relies on audible and visual components in order to function. This ability replaces fascinate.
Punchline			KEY:Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 6th level, the prankster can use his performance to tell a punchline to amuse a creature he has already mocked (see above), goading it into hideous laughter (as the spell). Using this ability does not disrupt the mock effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the mock effect). A prankster can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Telling a punchline does not count against a prankster's daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modif ier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Punchline is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language dependent ability and relies on audible components. This ability replaces the suggestion ability.
Mass Punchline		KEY:Mass Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:This ability functions just like punchline, but allows a prankster of 18th level or higher to use hideous laughter simultaneously against any number of creatures that he has mocked. This ability replaces the mass suggestion ability.
Swap				KEY:Swap ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A prankster can steal an object from a creature and replace it with another object of the same size or smaller that the prankster has in his hand. This functions as the steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322), but the prankster does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and may use his Sleight of Hand check in place of his combat maneuver check. If the prankster's check exceeds the target's CMD by 10 or more, the target is unaware the swap has been made until it tries to use the swapped object or the end of its next turn (whichever happens first). This ability replaces lore master.

Chameleon Mutagen			KEY:Chameleon Mutagen ~ Saboteur				CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a saboteur discovers how to create a special elixir that he can imbibe in order to heighten his ability to move undetected and his mobility at the cost of his physical might. When consumed, the elixir causes the saboteur's skin to change color to match the background and causes his hands and feet to secrete a sticky residue. This grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to half his alchemist level (minimum +1), as well as granting him a climb speed equal to half his base speed, for 10 minutes per saboteur level. In addition, while the chameleon extract is in effect, the saboteur takes a -2 penalty to his Strength. This ability replaces mutagen. A saboteur who drinks an alchemist's mutagen is treated as a non-alchemist. All limitations to mutagens apply to chameleon mutagen as if it were the same ability. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to the chameleon mutagen.

Bore Bomb*				KEY:Discovery ~ Bore Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he may choose to make it a bore bomb. If a bore bomb strikes a wall, gate, siege engine, or similar large, solid, inanimate structure, it ignores half the target's hardness and deals 1 point of damage per saboteur level. If a bore bomb reduces an inanimate target to half its hit points or fewer, it blows a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the target.
Complex Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Complex Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he can choose to have it modif ied by two different discoveries that modify a bomb's damage (those discoveries marked with an asterisk). Each discovery modif ies half the bomb's damage dice, rounding down. For example, a concussive/frost bomb from a 9th-level saboteur deals 2d4 points of sonic damage + 2d6 points of frost damage. Creating a complex bomb counts as 2 daily uses of the bomb ability.

A bonded witch has the following class features.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Bonded Item ~ Bonded Witch|PRECLASS:1,Witch=1
#
Bonded Item	KEY:Bonded Item ~ Bonded Witch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard's arcane bond bonded item (Core Rulebook 78), and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions. A bonded witch's bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way (Advanced Player's Guide 68), but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item. Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch's bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch's level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way.

Such alchemists can manipulate the forces of alchemy to create bombs that reshape terrain and defoliate swaths of vegetation or to create mutagens that bestow the resilience of oak or the tenacity of bamboo. A bramble brewer has the following class features.

Briar Bombs		KEY:Briar Bombs ~ Bramble Brewer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, a bramble brewer gains the tanglefoot bomb discovery (Ultimate Magic 17), but the entanglement's duration persists for a number of rounds equal to the bramble brewer's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 round). Additionally, when a bramble brewer throws a tanglefoot bomb, it transforms all squares in its splash radius into difficult terrain that persists for as long as the bomb's entangling effect. Although these bombs deal no damage, for every 1d6 points of damage the bramble brewer's regular bombs deal, the briar bomb's splash radius increases by 5 feet. This ability replaces the 2nd-level discovery class feature.
Dendrite Mutagen	KEY:Dendrite Mutagen ~ Bramble Brewer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a bramble brewer's mutagen still contains transformative power, but grants a treelike sturdiness rather than the feral power of standard mutagens. When imbibed, dendrite mutagen grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +2 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, and a -2 penalty to the corresponding mental ability score (as per the normal mutagen class feature; Advanced Player's Guide 28). In addition, the alchemist gains fast healing 1 as long as he is in an area of bright light (such as sunlight or inside the area of a daylight spell). This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the greater mutagen discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that still grants a +4 natural armor bonus, and also grants a +4 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score and a +2 bonus to a second physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, but his fast healing increases to 3 as long as he is in an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the greater mutagen discovery and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the grand mutagen discovery can brew a dendrite mutagen that now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +2 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's fast healing increases to 5 as long as he is within an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the grand mutagen discovery and replaces that ability.
Grand Discovery	KEY:Grand Discovery ~ Bramble Brewer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 20th level, a bramble brewer who selects the true mutagen grand discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that grants a +8 natural armor bonus and a +6 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's gains fast healing 10, but instead of only gaining fast healing in bright light, this fast healing persists in areas of bright or normal light. A bramble brewer must possess the grand mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.
Discoveries		KEY:Discoveries ~ Bramble Brewer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The following discoveries complement the bramble brewer archetype: precise bombs (Advanced Player's Guide); defoliant bomb (Advanced Race Guide); lingering spirit, strafe bomb, sunlight bomb (Ultimate Magic).

The wild caller calls eidolons that take more natural and savage forms and summons from nature rather than the Great Beyond. A wild caller has the following class features.

#
Spells			KEY:Spells ~ Wild Caller	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wild caller does not have access to summon monster spells. Instead, he swaps out those spells on his spell list with summon nature's ally spells of the same level. This ability alters the normal spell list of the summoner.
Eidolon			KEY:Eidolon ~ Wild Caller	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The eidolon of a wild caller tends to take more natural and more savage forms than other summoners' eidolons. A wild caller gains 1/4 his class level as bonus evolution points in his eidolon's evolution pool, but his eidolon cannot take the following evolutions: Advanced Player's Guide-1-point evolutions: magic attacks, skilled (while the eidolon can select this evolution, it can only do so with the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Survival, and Swim); 2-point evolutions: energy attacks, immunity, weapon training; 3-point evolutions: damage reduction, frightful presence; 4-point evolutions: breath weapon, spell resistance. Ultimate Magic-1-point evolutions: basic magic, unnatural aura; 2-point evolutions: channel resistance, head, minor magic, undead appearance; 3-point evolutions: major magic; 4-point evolutions: dimension door, incorporeal form, lifesense, no breath, ultimate magic. This ability alters the normal summoner's eidolon class feature, but is otherwise identical to that class feature.
Summon Nature's Ally I	KEY:Summon Nature's Ally I ~ Wild Caller	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a wild caller can cast summon nature's ally a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modif ier. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon nature's ally IX at 17th level). Furthermore, at 19th level, the wild caller cannot use gate as a spell-like ability, but can use either summon elder worm or summon froghemoth (Ultimate Magic 240) instead. This ability otherwise functions like the standard summoner's summon monster I ability and replaces that ability.

Such rangers stalk the wild like shadows, creating close bonds with the wild itself instead of seeking the solace and aid of companions. While ill at ease within cities and other urban areas, they are adept at using the terrain to tactical advantage; they dart through brambles and rough terrain with uncommon grace and use the land itself to lock down enemies. A wild shadow has the following class features.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Wild at Heart ~ Wild Shadow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Favored Terrain ~ Wild Shadow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=3		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Woodland Stride ~ Wild Shadow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=4		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Unfettered Step ~ Wild Shadow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=7		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Harrying Attack ~ Wild Shadow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=11		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Wild Stalker ~ Wild Shadow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=14		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Master of Terrain ~ Wild Shadow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=19
#
Wild at Heart		KEY:Wild at Heart ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a wild shadow adds only 1/2 his class level when making wild empathy checks while in urban areas, and adds only 1/4 his class level to follow or identify tracks in such areas. In non-urban settings, he is considered two levels higher when determining the bonuses for such checks. This ability alters the track and wild empathy class features.
Favored Terrain		KEY:Favored Terrain ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, when a wild shadow chooses a favored terrain, he cannot choose urban as the terrain type. Furthermore, at 8th level and every five levels thereafter, when he chooses a new favorite terrain type, he cannot choose the urban terrain type. This ability alters the favored terrain class feature.
Woodland Stride		KEY:Woodland Stride ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:This ability functions as the 7th level ranger class feature of the same name, but the wild shadow gains it at 4th level instead. This ability replaces the hunter's bond class feature.
Unfettered Step		KEY:Unfettered Step ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, a wild shadow's woodland stride class feature functions in any difficult terrain within any of his favored terrains, even in areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion. This ability replaces the ranger's woodland stride class feature gained at 7th level.
Harrying Attack		KEY:Harrying Attack ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level, a wild shadow can use his knowledge of terrain to make shrewd attacks in combat. Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow's favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.
Wild Stalker		KEY:Wild Stalker ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 14th level, a wild shadow learns to better use natural surroundings to obscure his position in combat. Whenever a wild shadow is within one of his favored terrains and a feature of that terrain grants him cover, the bonuses to AC and Reflex saves for that cover improve by 1. Additionally, while he is within one of his favored terrains, if he gains concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of either type of concealment improves by 10%%. Furthermore, at 16th level and 19th level, the bonuses granted by cover increase by 1 and the miss chance increases by another 10%% (maximum +3 and +30%% respectively at 20th level). This ability replaces the camouflage class feature.
Master of Terrain		KEY:Master of Terrain ~ Wild Shadow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 19th level, a wild shadow can use his harrying attack against creatures other than his favored enemy or he can spend a standard action to designate up to two of his favored enemies as his harried prey instead. This ability replaces the improved quarry class feature.

A blood god disciple generally fights by the avatar's side and offers it blood sacrifices in exchange for martial prowess. A blood god disciple has the following class features.

Blood Feast		KEY:Blood Feast ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has. At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer. This ability replaces the summon monster I, III, V, VII, and IX spell-like abilities.
Bloody Gift		KEY:Bloody Gift ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.
Avatar Gambit	KEY:Avatar Gambit ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.
Rage Power		KEY:Rage Power ~ Blood God Disciple		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level and 15th level, a blood god disciple selects a barbarian rage power, which he may use when raging (whether from the avatar gambit ability or actual barbarian rage). This replaces the summon monster VI and VIII spell-like abilities.

While some hide their shame, others foster a deep, burning hatred that they channel into a raw fury and unleash against their enemies. These half-orcs are called hateful ragers. A hateful rager has the following class features.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Reduced Rage ~ Hateful Rager|PRECLASS:1,Barbarian=2		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Favored Enemy ~ Hateful Rager|PRECLASS:1,Barbarian=2		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Feed the Rage ~ Hateful Rager|PRECLASS:1,Barbarian=5		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Amplified by Hate ~ Hateful Rager|PRECLASS:1,Barbarian=9		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Rage Power ~ Hateful Rager|PRECLASS:1,Barbarian=1

Reduced Rage	KEY:Reduced Rage ~ Hateful Rager		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level and every level thereafter, a hateful rager only gains 1 additional round of rage per day instead of the normal 2 additional rounds of rage per day.
Favored Enemy	KEY:Favored Enemy ~ Hateful Rager		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a hateful rager selects a favored enemy. This ability works identically to the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the hateful rager selects another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type, as described in the ranger class. While raging, the hateful rager makes every effort to fight a favored enemy rather than other opponents. If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way). She can avoid harmful obstacles normally in her attempts to reach the target and is not forced to take the shortest route. This ability replaces the barbarian's rage power gained at 2nd level. At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, in place of a rage power she gains another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type.
Feed the Rage	KEY:Feed the Rage ~ Hateful Rager		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 5th level, a hateful rager gains 1 additional round of rage for each favored enemy she knocks unconscious or kills in combat. These current rounds of rage can only be used to add to the duration of her rage, and disappear when the rage ends. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.
Amplified by Hate	KEY:Amplified by Hate ~ Hateful Rager	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 9th level, a hateful rager adds half her favored enemy bonus to the DC of any rage power she uses against a favored enemy. This ability replaces trap sense +3.

Some half-orc paladins take up these misunderstood creatures as their cause, standing up for the monstrous creatures and, when possible, leading them to the light. These paladins are called redeemers. A redeemer has the following class features.

Merciful Smite	KEY:Merciful Smite ~ Redeemer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, when a redeemer chooses to smite a creature, she can have all of her attacks against the target deal nonlethal damage. She does not take the normal -4 attack roll penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. She cannot use this ability to deal nonlethal damage to outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, or undead creatures (these creatures take lethal damage from her smite). This otherwise works like and replaces the standard paladin's smite evil.
Monstrous Rapport	KEY:Monstrous Rapport ~ Redeemer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, redeemers gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to inf luence creatures who are commonly considered monstrous.

Pact of Peace	KEY:Pact of Peace ~ Redeemer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 8th level, a redeemer can force a defeated creature to accept a binding pact of peace as a condition of its surrender, as if using lesser geas. Her caster level for this ability is equal to her paladin level. Rather than assigning a mission or task, the redeemer gives the creature a simple set of prohibitions to protect others. Example geas include "Leave this city and do not return" or "Do not attack caravans." The prohibition must be against an area no larger than 300 square miles or one specific group of people (such as a tribe or citizens of a particular city). This ability lasts 1 month per paladin level. This replaces aura of resolve.
Aura of Mercy	KEY:Aura of Mercy ~ Redeemer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, a redeemer can expend two uses of her merciful smite ability to grant the merciful smite ability to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this merciful smite ability by the start of the paladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benef it from this ability. This replaces aura of justice.
Associates		KEY:Associates ~ Redeemer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality			DESC:A redeemer may ally with an evil creature as long as she feels the creature is capable of redemption. A redeemer may accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are not lawful good provided they demonstrate they are willing to follow her and seek betterment under her tutelage.

When she uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher's class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal -20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action.

Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable.

Shadow Summoning			KEY:Shadow Summoning ~ Shadow Caller	SOURCEPAGE:p.110	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When a shadow caller uses his summon monster ability or casts the summon monster spell, he typically summons creatures from the Shadow Plane or creatures closely associated with shadow. When a creature on the summon monster spell list indicates that it is summoned with either the celestial or the fiendish template based on the alignment of the caster, the creature summoned by the shadow caller has the shadow creature template instead (see sidebar). Furthermore, the summon monster lists are modified in the following ways (these changes also apply to using a higher-level summon spell to summon multiple creatures from a lower-level list). Summon Monster I: No changes. Summon Monster II: A shadow caller cannot summon Small elementals or lemures, but instead can summon zoogs (Bestiary 3 288).

Shadow Eidolon				KEY:Shadow Eidolon ~ Shadow Caller		SOURCEPAGE:p.111	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality				CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A shadow caller's eidolon is at once a thing of shadow called from the deep of the Shadow Plane and his own shadow; the two are inseparable. When his eidolon manifests, his shadow lengthens and finally detaches from him as a creature unto itself. For as long as the shadow caller's eidolon is manifested, he and the eidolon do not have distinct shadows, regardless of the presence or absence of light. This lack of a shadow replaces the magical symbol that identifies the summoner and his eidolon. This ability alters the summoner's eidolon ability.

Servant of the Flame			KEY:Servant of the Flame ~ Immolator	SOURCEPAGE:p.124	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality				CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:An immolator must worship a deity whose portfolio includes the Fire domain.

Any creature slain by this weapon burns with magical flame; its body turns to ash, though its equipment is not harmed. This special ability only functions while the immolator wields the weapon. This ability lasts for %1 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. At 12th level, this ability gives the immolator's weapon the flaming burst weapon special ability. This ability replaces bane and greater bane.|ImmolatorBurntOfferingRounds
Judgment by Fire				KEY:Judgment by Fire ~ Immolator		SOURCEPAGE:p.124	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DEFINE:ImmolatorJudgementByFireSave|10+Inquisitor/2+WIS		DESC:At 20th level, an immolator can call fiery judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an immolator uses her judgment ability, she can invoke a judgment by fire on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the immolator can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, the attack deals fire damage instead of weapon damage, and the target must make a successful Fortitude save or die (creatures immune to fire do not have to save). The DC of this save is %1. Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the immolator's judgment by fire ability for 24 hours. Creatures killed in this manner explode in a burst of fire, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to every creature within 5 feet (Reflex save for half damage, DC %1). Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. This ability modifies and functions as true judgment.|ImmolatorJudgementByFireSave

However, like the genies they are descended from, wishcrafters can only draw upon this power to fulfill the desires of others. A wishcrafter has the following class features.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Wishbound Arcana ~ Wishcrafter|PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=1		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Expanded Wishcraft ~ Wishcrafter|PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=3		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Heart's Desire ~ Wishcrafter|PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=7		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Twisted Wish ~ Wishcrafter|PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=13		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Perfect Wishcraft ~ Wishcrafter|PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=19
#
Wishbound Arcana				KEY:Wishbound Arcana ~ Wishcrafter		SOURCEPAGE:p.124	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, the wishcrafter can use the wishes of non-genie creatures other than herself in place of the normal verbal components of her spells. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the wishcrafter's turn. The wishcrafter must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn't normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn't need to mention the name of a specific spell, but must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the wishcrafter knows (for example, wishing to be bigger could supply the verbal component for enlarge person). A wishcrafter gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature's wish as a verbal component in this manner, but cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than a target or targets. A wishcrafter is under no compulsion to grant a creature's wish. Once the wishcrafter grants a creature's wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours. This ability replaces bloodline arcana.
# Implement must add to list of spells known
Expanded Wishcraft				KEY:Expanded Wishcraft ~ Wishcrafter	SOURCEPAGE:p.124	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality				CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the wishcrafter grows more adept at altering reality to fit the whims of others. She may add an additional spell selected from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her list of spells known. This spell must be one level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. A wishcrafter can only use these spells in conjunction with her wishbound arcana ability. For example, if she used this ability to learn cat's grace, she can only cast it when another creature wishes for it, and can't cast it on herself because it is a targeted spell. She cannot use these spells to craft or recharge magic items. These bonus spells replace the bloodline spells gained by the sorcerer's bloodline.
Heart's Desire					KEY:Heart's Desire ~ Wishcrafter		SOURCEPAGE:p.124	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 7th level, as a swift action, a wishcrafter can force a single creature within 30 feet to confess its deepest desire. The target receives a Will save to negate this effect (DC %1). On a failed save, the creature must immediately wish aloud in a clear voice for something it truly desires, allowing the wishcrafter to activate her wishbound arcana ability if she knows a spell that can fulfill that wish. This is a mind-affecting effect. Regardless of whether the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the same wishcrafter's heart's desire ability again for 24 hours. The wishcrafter can use this ability %2 times per day. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 7th level.|10+Sorceror/2+CHA|CHA
Twisted Wish					KEY:Twisted Wish ~ Wishcrafter			SOURCEPAGE:p.125	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 13th level, a wishcrafter becomes adept at corrupting wishes to negatively affect the creature that wished them. When a wishcrafter affects a creature with a spell using its wish as a spell component, she may twist the wish, applying a -4 penalty to the creature's saving throws against the spell. The effects of wishes twisted this way are difficult to remove; the DC of caster level checks to dispel them increases by 5. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 13th level.
Perfect Wishcraft				KEY:Perfect Wishcraft ~ Wishcrafter		SOURCEPAGE:p.125	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 19th level, the wishcrafter perfects her ability to manipulate reality. Once per day, she may cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on her list of spells known. Using this ability otherwise has all of the benefits and limitations of the wishbound arcana ability. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 19th level.

# Implement as Gunslinger Grit ability
Trembling Grit					KEY:Trembling Grit ~ Bushwhacker			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, at the start of each day, a bushwhacker gains grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier - 1 (minimum of 1). In addition to all the ways any gunslinger can regain grit, a bushwhacker who reduces a helpless or unaware opponent to 0 hit points or fewer also regains 1 grit point. This expands the way in which the bushwhacker gains grit points, so a bushwhacker who gains grit points in this way only gains 1 grit point for reducing a helpless or unaware opponent, not 2 grit points. This otherwise works like the gunslinger's grit ability and alters that ability.
# Implement as Gunslinger Deeds
Craven Deeds					KEY:Craven Deeds ~ Bushwhacker				SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A bushwhacker replaces some of her deeds with the following deeds. This ability otherwise works like the gunslinger's deed ability and alters that ability.
Shifty Shot						KEY:Shifty Shot ~ Bushwhacker				SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, a bushwhacker with at least 1 grit point deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using her firearm to attack opponents denied their Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not). Except for the requirement that she must use a firearm and must have at least 1 grit point to use it, this deed otherwise works identically to a rogue's sneak attack class feature (including the requirement that she must be within 30 feet of her target to deal this extra damage), and stacks with the sneak shot ability (see below) and sneak attack. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.
Long Range Shifty Shot			KEY:Long Range Shifty Shot ~ Bushwhacker	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 7th level, a bushwhacker can double the range at which she deals extra damage from a sneak attack or shifty shot (from 30 feet to 60 feet) with a firearm by spending 1 grit point. When she spends this grit point, she must still have at least 1 grit point left to deal extra damage from shifty shot if she is using this deed. This deed replaces the targeting deed.
Sneak Shot						KEY:Sneak Shot ~ Bushwhacker				SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a bushwhacker deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using a firearm to attack opponents who are unable to properly defend themselves. Unlike with the shifty shot ability, she deals this extra damage regardless of whether or not she has any grit points when making the attack. Except for the requirement that she makes a firearm attack, this works identically to a rogue's sneak attack class feature. This extra damage stacks with sneak attack and the damage from shifty shot. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.

Kobold Sorcerer Bloodline		KEY:Kobold Sorcerer Bloodline	CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Bloodline		PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=1	PRERACE:1,Kobold		DESC:While many kobold sorcerers tout their purely draconic bloodline, over generations of eldritch training, some such spellcasters have created a bloodline that, while tinged with some draconic magic, is the embodiment of the race's virtue distilled into arcane form. Many practitioners of this bloodline go on to lead powerful kobold tribes.

As your power increases, you discover ever more useful ways to blend your magic with these instinctive talents.
Trap Rune						KEY:Trap Rune ~ Kobold Sorcerer Bloodline			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, as a standard action, you can sketch a single, nearly invisible magical rune on any 5-foot-square solid surface. When you create a rune, pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. While the rune is active, the next creature other than you who steps on or touches the rune's area causes the rune to explode. The rune's explosion deals a number of points of energy damage equal to 1d8 + 1 per sorcerer level you possess to anything in its square. A Ref lex saving throw halves the damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier). The rune is considered a magical trap for the purpose of perceiving it or disabling it. The DC for both Perception and Disable Device checks is the same as the Ref lex saving throw to halve the damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Each rune lasts for 24 hours or until discharged.
Trap Sense						KEY:Trap Sense ~ Kobold Sorcerer Bloodline			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, you develop a sixth sense that helps you avoid traps. You gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks made to notice traps. You also gain a +1 bonus on Ref lex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 at 7th level and for every four sorcerer levels you gain thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). This bonus stacks with that provided by a rogue's trap sense and similar abilities.
Arcane Ambush					KEY:Arcane Ambush ~ Kobold Sorcerer Bloodline		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, as a swift action, you can expend a spell slot in order to grant you and your allies a bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus lasts 1 round, is equal to the level of the spell expended, and only applies to opponents your allies are f lanking or opponents denied their Dexterity bonus against your allies. You grant this bonus to yourself plus up to one ally for every four sorcerer levels you possess (to a maximum of five allies at 20th level). The allies must be within 30 feet of you and you must have line of effect to each affected ally.
Earth Glide						KEY:Earth Glide ~ Kobold Sorcerer Bloodline			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 15th level, you gain the earth glide universal monster ability (Bestiary 2 296) with a speed equal to your base speed. This does not give you the ability to breathe while passing through earth, so you must hold your breath or use some alternate method to breathe while using this ability.
Nimble Walker					KEY:Nimble Walker ~ Kobold Sorcerer Bloodline		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 20th level, you gain a +5 racial bonus on Ref lex saving throws and on Acrobatics checks made to move through a creature's threatened area or through its space.

Fetish Mask						KEY:Fetish Mask ~ Scarred Witch Doctor				SOURCEPAGE:p.140	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a scarred witch doctor forms a bond with a wooden mask. As she gains power, her connection to this mask causes it to grow ever more hideous and grotesque as it absorbs the weight of the self-induced pain that underlies her magic. Her spells derive from the insights her patron grants her while she's enduring the cuts, burns, and other sorts of mutilations she inf licts upon herself. Her fetish mask acts in all ways like a witch's familiar for the purpose of preparing and gaining spells. Rather than communing with a familiar to prepare spells each day, a scarred witch doctor hangs her mask on a wall, tree branch, or something similar and contemplates the agony it represents. When wearing her fetish mask, a scarred witch doctor gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal and Intimidate checks and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that specifically cause pain or have the pain descriptor. If the mask is destroyed, the witch doctor can create another fetish mask (which almost immediately adopts the shocking appearance of the original) for the same price and time it takes a witch to replace a dead familiar. At 5th level, the scarred witch doctor gains the ability to add magical abilities to her mask as if she had the Craft Wondrous Item feat.

Since these battlegrounds often have tight corners and few areas with long lines of sight, those ratfolk who seek to master the use of firearms almost inevitably become experts in closequarters combat. These gulch gunners often specialize in proficiency with a single pistol (easily handled in tight spaces) and wander from warren to warren selling their tunnel-shooting skills to the highest bidder.

When she makes an attack against a foe within her firearm's first range increment, she may spend 1 grit point to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against that opponent until the beginning of her next turn. She can only perform this deed while wearing medium, light, or no armor, and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.
Powder Burns					KEY:Powder Burns ~ Gulch Gunner						SOURCEPAGE:p.152	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, the gulch gunner learns to maximize the damage dealt by a firearm at extremely close range. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent foe with a ranged firearm attack, she may spend 1 grit point to deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage from the muzzle flash of her weapon. The target must also make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner's level + the gulch gunner's Wisdom modifier) or catch on fire. This deed replaces the pistol whip deed.
Staggering Shot					KEY:Staggering Shot ~ Gulch Gunner					SOURCEPAGE:p.152	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 15th level, when the gulch gunner hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, the target must also make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner's level + the gulch gunner's Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Plague Vial						KEY:Plague Vial ~ Plague Bringer					SOURCEPAGE:p.153	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a plague bringer can create a plague vial, an alchemically grown and concentrated disease sample. It takes 1 hour to prepare a plague vial, and once prepared, the vial remains potent until used. A plague bringer can only maintain 1 plague vial at a time-if he prepares a second vial, any existing plague vial becomes inert. A plague vial that is not in a plague bringer's possession becomes inert until a plague bringer picks it up again. It's a standard action to drink a plague vial. Upon being imbibed, the plague vial infects the plague bringer's blood, sweat, tears, and other bodily fluids for %10 minutes. Any creature that harms him with melee attacks (except with reach weapons) must make a Fortitude save (DC %2) or become sickened for %1 rounds. The plague bringer is immune to the effect of his own plague vial, but not that of another's plague vial. The effects of multiple plague vials do not stack. As a standard action, the plague bringer can infect a weapon with this sickness (typically by licking it or wiping his blood or pus on it). The disease on the weapon works like a poisoned weapon, except the source is a disease instead of a poison (so a dwarf 's resistance to poison does not apply). Anyone other than a plague bringer (including another alchemist) who drinks a plague vial must make a saving throw against the vial's DC or become nauseated for 1 hour. Unless he learns how to brew a mutagen by taking the mutagen discovery (see Ultimate Magic), he can never benefit from a mutagen and reacts to it as if he were a non-alchemist. At any particular time, a plague bringer can only be under the effect of either a plague vial or a mutagen (not both); drinking another immediately ends the effects of any ongoing plague vial or mutagen. All limitations to mutagens apply to plague vials as if they were the same substance. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to plague vials. The sticky poison discovery applies to a weapon infected with a plague vial. The plague vial is a disease effect. This ability replaces mutagen.|AlchemistLvl|10+AlchemistLvl/2+Int

The wind listener can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a cantrip in order to cast a divination spell of the same spell level or lower.

This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 10th level.|WizardLvl
Listening to the Wind			KEY:Listening to the Wind ~ Wind Listener			SOURCEPAGE:p.158	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 15th level, the wind listener can call upon spirits of the air to uncover lost lore about a legendary person, place, or thing. Invoking the spirits takes 10 minutes, during which time the wind listener must be free of distractions and able to concentrate. Once called, the spirits seek out information on the subject of the wind listener's inquiries. This functions as the spell legend lore (caster level equal to the wind listener's level), except that the wind listener is free to engage in other activities while spirits investigate on his behalf. The time required for the air spirits to return with this information is equal to what the casting time of the spell legend lore would have been if the wind listener had cast it. The wind listener can use this ability once per week, and only if he does not currently have air spirits searching for information. If the air spirits are currently searching for information, the wind listener can end their task early as a standard action, dismissing the magical effect and not returning any information. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 15th level.

The number of points in the shigenjo's ki pool is equal to 1/3 her oracle level + her Charisma modifier. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.

The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is permanent. The shigenjo can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.

Infernal Mortification	TYPE:Supernatural	KEY:Infernal Mortification ~ Fiend Flayer		SOURCEPAGE:p.170	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a fiend flayer can sacrifice some of his own infernal blood to add to his arcane pool. Sacrificing blood in this way is a standard action. For every 2 points of Constitution damage the fiend flayer takes in this way, his arcane pool increases by 1 point.

Doing so costs 2 points from his arcane pool. The weapon can take the form of any single one-handed melee weapon the fiend f layer is proficient with. This weapon starts as a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus, but for every four levels beyond 3rd the fiend f layer possesses, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level. This summoned weapon lasts for 1 minute. At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties to the fiendblade: anarchic, axiomatic, dancing, f laming, burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or unholy. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool points are spent and cannot be changed until the next time the fiend f layer uses this arcana. Another creature cannot wield the fiendblade; if it leaves the hand of the fiend f layer, it dissipates in a wisp of red smoke that smells of burning blood. A fiend f layer can only have one fiendblade in existence at a time. If he uses this ability again, the first fiendblade disappears.

But these mortal clerics are often just shallow beings searching for quick power or the caress of true and final oblivion-few truly grasp the full scope of the entities they worship. Fiendish vessels, through their fiendish heritage, share an innate connection with their patron, and that connection grants them understanding and power.

Channel Evil	TYPE:Supernatural	KEY:Channel Evil ~ Fiendish Vessel		SOURCEPAGE:p.170	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a fiendish vessel, rather than channeling positive or negative energy, instead channels the pure evil power of her fiendish patron. This ability is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead and dealing damage to living creatures, this blast of evil energy automatically heals evil creatures and debilitates good creatures within its burst. Channeling this evil causes a burst that affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius centered on the fiendish vessel. In the case of evil creatures, the amount of damage healed is equal to %1d4 points of damage. Good creatures in the burst receive a Will saving throw to negate this damage. Good creatures that fail their saving throws are sickened for 1d4 rounds. Good creatures with a number of Hit Dice less than or equal %2 that fail their saving throws are nauseated for 1 round and then sickened for 1d4 rounds instead. The DC of this save is equal to %3. Neutral creatures are unaffected by this burst of evil energy. A fiendish vessel may channel this energy %4 times per day. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A fiendish vessel can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A fiendish vessel must present her unholy symbol or use her familiar as the divine focus for this ability. For the purposes of feats that affect channel energy, this ability counts as channeling negative energy. If the feat changes the way the fiendish vessel channels or deals damage with her channeling, use the amount of damage this ability heals evil creatures to determine the damage-dealing potential of the affected ability. For instance, if a 5th-level fiendish vessel takes the Channel Smite feat, her channeling deals an additional 3d4 points of damage to living creatures on a successful hit (though they may save to negate the damage). This ability replaces channel energy.|min(10,1+(ClericLvl-1)/2)|ClericLvl-5|10+ClericLvl/2+CHA|3+CHA
# Implement special familiar rules
Fiendish Familiar	KEY:Fiendish Familiar ~ Fiendish Vessel		SOURCEPAGE:p.171	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, a fiendish vessel's patron rewards her with a fiendish servant. The fiendish vessel gains an imp, quasit, or cacodaemon familiar based on the patron she worships. If she worships Asmodeus or an archdevil, she gets an imp; if she worships a demon lord, she gets a quasit; and if she worships one of the Four Horsemen, she gains a cacodaemon. This ability is identical to the wizard's arcane bond with a familiar and the Improved Familiar feat, using the fiendish vessel's character level in place of the wizard level. This tiny fiend acts like a perverse, manifest moral compass. Furthermore, this familiar can act as a living divine focus and unholy symbol for her spellcasting if the fiendish vessel so desires, which means that when she uses her channel evil ability, its burst can be centered on the familiar instead, as long as that familiar is within 30 feet and line of sight. A fiendish vessel's familiar tends to be fawning and subservient to the fiendish vessel. Should her familiar die, the fiendish vessel's patron replaces the familiar with an identical one within 1 week, without the need for a special ritual. Furthermore, the fiendish familiar gains the following special abilities beyond the standard familiar special abilities.
Fiendish Augury	TYPE:SpellLike	KEY:Fiendish Augury ~ Fiendish Vessel		SOURCEPAGE:p.172	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, the fiendish vessel can ask the familiar whether a particular course of action will bring good or bad results for her in the immediate future. This ability acts like the augury spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel's level, with the familiar acting as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day.
Fiendish Divination	TYPE:SpellLike	KEY:Fiendish Divination ~ Fiendish Vessel		SOURCEPAGE:p.172	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, the fiendish vessel can use a more powerful form of divination to gain intelligence from her patron through her fiendish familiar. This ability acts like the divination spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel's level; the familiar acts as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day.

The attack can originate from any square of water the bard is manipulating, and the water can get a f lanking bonus or help a combatant get one, but cannot make attacks of opportunity. The water can make multiple attacks per round if your base attack bonus allows you to do so. At 10th level, the water's slam damage increases to 1d8 points and the water gains a reach of 10 feet.
