Although you are of mixed heritage, you are closer to your
elven relatives and the magic in their blood f lows freely in
your veins.
Prerequisite: Half-elf.
Benefit: You possess the elven magic racial trait of
the elves, granting you a +2 racial bonus on caster level
checks made to overcome spell resistance. In addition,
you receive a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made

Beast Rider			TYPE:General
You gain the service of a monstrous companion or mount.
Prerequisites: Animal companion or mount class
feature, character level 7th, half-orc or orc.
Benefit: Select one of the following creature types:
elephant, pteranodon, rhinoceros, stegosaurus, or
triceratops. Add this creature type to your list of possible
animal companions or mounts. When summoning
a creature of the selected type to serve as a mount or
companion, treat your effective druid level as if it were two
levels higher (to a maximum of your character level). If the
creature is large enough for you to ride, it gains the combat
training general purpose (see Handle Animal) at no cost.

Blood Vengeance			TYPE:General
Seeing an ally fall in combat fills you with a raging and
murderous fury.
Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, nonlawful.
Benefit: Whenever one of your allies is reduced to
negative hit points or killed, you may enter a state similar
to but less powerful than a barbarian’s rage as a free action
on your next turn. If you have the rage class feature and
are already raging, your morale bonuses to Strength and
Constitution increase by +2 for the duration of your rage.
If you do not have the rage class feature, or you have no
more rage rounds left, this weaker rage gives you all the
benefits and penalties of a barbarian’s rage, except your
morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. In
either case, this state lasts for 4 rounds.
As with a barbarian’s rage, when this weaker rage ends,
you are fatigued; if another ally falls before this duration
ends, the weaker rage lasts for an additional 4 rounds.
This feat does not allow you to enter a rage if you are
fatigued. You may only use this feat if the fallen ally had
at least as many Hit Dice as you (excluding conjured or
summoned allies).

Destroyer’s Blessing			TYPE:Combat
Breaking things adds to your power.
Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.
Benefit: When you are raging and you succeed at a
sunder combat maneuver, you regain 1 round of rage. If
the sunder attempt causes the object to gain the broken
condition, you heal 1 hit point. You can only gain these
benefits once per round.

Ferocious Resolve			TYPE:General
Your orc heritage allows you to fight on.
Prerequisites: Con 13, half-orc, orc ferocity racial trait.
Benefit: You gain the ferocity universal monster
ability, allowing you to continue fighting at negative hit
points. When using this ability, you gain a +2 bonus on
Intimidate checks.
Normal: A half-orc with the orc ferocity racial trait can
fight for 1 more round after he is brought below 0 hit points.

Ferocious Summons			TYPE:General
Your summoned creatures gain your ferocity.
Prerequisites: Augment Summoning, Spell Focus
(conjuration), half-orc or orc.
Benefit: Creatures you summon gain the ferocity
universal monster ability.

Ferocious Tenacity			TYPE:Combat
You spit in the face of death.
Prerequisites: Ferocity racial trait, half-orc or orc, rage
class feature.
Benefit: Once per day when raging, if you are hit by an
attack that would deal enough hit points of damage to
kill you (negative hit points equal to your Constitution
score), as an immediate action you may expend 1 or more
rounds of rage to negate some of this damage and keep
yourself alive. Each round of rage you spend reduces the
attack’s damage by 1 point, but cannot reduce the damage
taken below 1 hit point.
For example, if you are raging, have a raging
Constitution score of 18, are currently at 2 hit points,
and take 20 hit points of damage from a hit (which is
enough to bring you to –18 hit points, thereby killing
you), you may spend 1 round of rage to reduce the
damage by 1 hit point (leaving you perilously close to
death at –17 hit points); if you spend 17 rounds of rage,
you reduce the damage to 1 (the minimum), leaving you
with 1 hit point.
Note: If this damage still makes you fall unconscious,
your rage ends just like it normally would, lowering your
Constitution to its normal value and reducing your hit
point total as normal. Therefore, it is possible to use this
feat to prevent yourself from instantly dying, yet you still
die because your negative hit points exceed your normal
Constitution score—take your normal Constitution into
account when deciding how many rounds of rage to spend
with this feat.

Gore Fiend			TYPE:General
Horrible wounds, whether on yourself or your enemies,
make your blood sing.
Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.
Benefit: When you are raging and you confirm a critical
hit with a melee weapon or a critical hit is confirmed on you
(whether by a melee weapon, spell, or ranged weapon), you
regain 1 round of rage (up to your maximum for the day).
You can only gain this benefit once per round.

Horde Charge			TYPE:Teamwork
When you charge with an ally, you are more deadly.
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1, half-orc or orc.
Benefit: When charging during the same round as
an ally with this feat, you gain a +2 bonus on attack and
damage rolls in addition to the normal bonus for charging.
If you can make multiple attacks on a charge, this bonus
only applies to the first attack.

Improved Surprise Follow-Through			TYPE:Combat
You follow up an attack with a surprising series of
sweeping blows.
Prerequisites: Str 13, Cleave, Great Cleave, Power
Attack, Surprise Follow Through, base attack bonus +8.
Benefit: When using Great Cleave, each opponent you
attack on your turn (other than the first) is denied his
Dexterity bonus against you.

Resilient Brute			TYPE:General
You absorb punishment others find deadly.
Prerequisite: Half-orc or orc.
Benefit: Once per day, when a creature confirms a
critical hit against you, you may treat half the damage
as nonlethal damage. You cannot use this ability if you
are immune to nonlethal damage. When your base attack
bonus reaches +10, you may use this ability an additional
time per day.

Surprise Follow-Through			TYPE:Combat
When striking one opponent, you catch its ally off guard.
Prerequisites: Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, base attack
bonus +1.
Benefit: When using Cleave or Great Cleave, the second
foe you attack on your turn is denied its Dexterity bonus
against you.

Sympathetic Rage			TYPE:Combat
Seeing an ally rage f ills you with your own fury.
Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, nonlawful.
Benefit: Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is
raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less powerful
rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage gives
you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian’s rage,
except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution
is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can rage, as
long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example,
you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally
toward another raging ally and maintain your rage). As
with a barbarian’s rage, when this weaker rage ends, you
are fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are fatigued.

Tenacious Survivor			TYPE:General
Your spirit lingers long after any other’s would have
passed on.
Prerequisites: Con 13, Diehard, Endurance, half-orc
or orc.
Benefit: When you are killed by hit point damage, your
soul lingers in your body for a number of rounds equal to
your Constitution bonus. You are still dead, but a creature
can make a DC 10 Heal check as a standard action to realize
that you can still be saved. You can be healed by magic as if
you were alive. If you are healed enough hit points that you
would no longer be dead, you are alive again, but you gain
one permanent negative level.

Thrill of the Kill			TYPE:General
Killing fuels your rage.
Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.
Benefit: When you are raging and your attack reduces
an enemy to negative hit points or kills it, you regain 1
round of rage. You may only use this feat if the fallen
enemy had at least as many Hit Dice as you. You can only
gain this benefit once per round.

You are extremely lucky and sometimes your allies are
as well.
Prerequisites: Defiant Luck, Inexplicable Luck, human.
Benefit: You gain an extra use per day of your Defiant
Luck ability. You can also use your Inexplicable Luck
ability to grant an ally that can see and hear its benefit as
an immediate action.

Critical Versatility			TYPE:Combat
An open mind and combat training grant versatility to
your critical hits.
Prerequisites: Fighter level 11th, human.

Your ability to avert disaster is impressive.
Prerequisites: Cha 13, Fearless Curiosity, Intimidate 10
ranks, human.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws
against effects with the emotion descriptor; this bonus
stacks with those granted by Fearless Curiosity and
Intimidating Confidence. In addition, once per day you
may reroll a natural 1 on a saving throw or an attack
roll. If your reroll results in a successful saving throw or
attack roll, as a free action you can make an Intimidate
check to demoralize the target of your attack or the
creature that forced you to make a saving throw, as long
as the creature is within 30 feet and can see and hear you.
This effect does not apply on saving throws against traps
or other objects. This does not stack with other effects
that allow you to reroll a saving throw or an attack roll.
You may only make one reroll.

You can sometimes defiantly shrug off spells and attacks
that would kill a lesser creature.
Prerequisite: Human.
Benefit: Once per day, after you roll a natural 1 on a
saving throw or a critical hit is confirmed against you,
you can either reroll that saving throw, or force the
creature that confirmed the critical hit against you to
reroll the critical confirmation roll. This does not stack
with other effects that allow you to reroll a saving throw
or an attack roll. You may only make one reroll.
Special: If you are using the optional hero point system
(Advanced Player’s Guide 322–324), you can also spend 1 hero
point when a critical hit is confirmed against you to have
the opponent reroll the critical hit confirmation roll.

Your desire to see and experience the world overrides
healthy caution.
Prerequisites: Cha 13, human.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against

you gain a new save at the beginning of your turn to reduce
the severity of the fear effect, from panicked to frightened,
frightened to shaken, and shaken to unaffected.

Heroic Will			TYPE:General
Your indomitable will breaks free from mental shackles.
Prerequisites: Iron Will, base Will save +4, human.
Benefit: Once per day as a standard action, you may
attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition
requiring a Will save that is affecting you. If you are
dominated, controlled, or cannot take an action because
of the effect against which you are trying to make a new
saving throw, you can make this saving throw at the start
of the turn as no action, but on a success, your turn ends.
You cannot use this feat to remove instantaneous effects,
effects that do not require a Will save, or effects that do
not allow a saving throw.
