Class Skills	KEY:Class Skills ~ Ancient Lorekeeper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An ancient lorekeeper adds Knowledge (arcane) and Knowledge (local) to her list of class skills. Whenever she makes a Knowledge check of any kind about a question regarding elves (creatures of the elf subtype), the ancient lorekeeper adds half her class level on her check. This replaces the bonus skills the ancient lorekeeper gains from her mystery.
Elven Arcana	KEY:Elven Arcana ~ Ancient Lorekeeper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, an ancient lorekeeper's mastery of elven legends and philosophy has allowed her to master one spell used by elven wizards. She selects one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest-level oracle spell she can cast. The ancient lorekeeper gains this as a bonus spell known. The spell is treated as one level higher than its true level for all purposes. The ancient lorekeeper may choose an additional spell at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels. This ability replaces the bonus spells she would normally gain at these levels from her chosen mystery.

Many elven magi do not consider themselves masters of a blend of martial and magical talents, but rather a sub-category of wizards who study the effect of physical movement and techniques upon spellcasting ability. They believe their ability to cast spells while fighting is an outgrowth of the concept of the "spell dance," which itself is just another kind of wizardry. A spell dancer has the following class features.

Spell Dance				KEY:Spell Dance ~ Spell Dancer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spell dancer gains the ability to expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to his movement rate and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through threatened spaces for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the spell dancer gains another +10 enhancement bonus to movement and +2 to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked from movement. At 5th level, once per spell dance as a swift action, the spell dancer may use one of the following on himself as a swift action: blur, fly, or haste. These abilities last for 1 round. At 9th level, the spell dancer may instead take a swift action to use dimension door as a spell-like ability once during a spelldance. At 13th level, the spell dancer may instead choose to take a swift action to gain freedom of movement for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces the magus's ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.
Arcane Movement			KEY:Arcane Movement ~ Spell Dancer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, whenever a spell dancer casts a magus spell, he gains a competence bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, and Stealth checks equal to the spell's level until the beginning of his next turn. This ability replaces the bonus feat a magus receives at 5th level.
Dance of Avoidance		KEY:Dance of Avoidance ~ Spell Dancer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 7th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer gains a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class. This ability replaces the medium armor class feature.

These spells become so well understood by the spellbinder that he can prepare them in spell slots that already have other spells prepared in them.

Spell Bond		KEY:Spell Bond ~ Spellbinder	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spellbinder selects any one spell that he knows as a bonded spell. As a full-round action, the spellbinder may replace a spell of the same or higher level as his bonded spell with his bonded spell. For example, a spellbinder who selects magic missile as his bonded spell could spend a full-round action to exchange any 1st-level or higher spell that he has prepared with magic missile. At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder may select another spell he knows and add it to his list of bonded spells, to a maximum of nine bonded spells at 17th level. Upon reaching 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder can choose to select a new spell as a bonded spell in place of one with which he is already bonded. In effect, the spellbinder loses the bond with the old spell (though it is still one of his spells known) in exchange for forging a spell bond with a new spell. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A spellbinder may swap only one spell bond at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell bond at the same time that he gains two new spells known for the level. This ability replaces arcane bond.

	DESC:Elves live far longer than other common races, and a single elf may see whole empires rise and fall. Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it's small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest's plants into combat. A treesinger has the following class features.

Plant Bond		KEY:Plant Bond ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger forms a mystic bond with plant life. This bond can take one of two forms. The first grants the treesinger one of the following domains: Plant (Core Rulebook); Growth (Advanced Player's Guide); Jungle, Swamp (Ultimate Magic). When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously. The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions (see page 26). This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid's animal companion ability. Plant bond replaces the druid's nature bond ability.
Green Empathy	KEY:Green Empathy ~ Treesinger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger can improve the attitude of a plant creature. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The treesinger rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the treesinger and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with inf luencing people, it might take more or less time. A treesinger can also use this ability to inf luence an animal, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.
Wild Shape		KEY:Wild Shape ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a treesinger gains the ability to wild shape. This ability functions at her actual druid level. A treesinger cannot use wild shape to adopt an animal or elemental form. Instead, when she gains this ability at 4th level, she can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant. This functions as plant shape I, except the treesinger does not yet gain access to the constrict or poison abilities of the plant form assumed. At 8th level, the treesinger's wild shape gains the full range of abilities available from plant shape I. At 10th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Large or Tiny plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape II. At 12th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Huge plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape III. This ability replaces, and otherwise functions like, the normal druid wild shape ability.

#Plant Companions
#Each plant companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions cannot gain armor or weapon proficiency feats, even as they advance in hit dice, and cannot use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise. As you gain levels, your plant companion grows in power as well. It gains the same bonuses that are gained by animal companions, noted on Table 3-8: Animal Companion Base Statistics on page 52 of the Core Rulebook. Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each plant choice. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Strength and Constitution by 2.

Prankster	KEY:Bard Archetype ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:Archetype.BardArchetype		PRECLASS:1,Bard=1	PRERACE:1,Elf%	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Bard Archetype ~ Prankster],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]	DESC:The prankster sees humor as the highest form or art, and pranks as the highest form of humor. In addition to setting friends up for light-hearted pranks, the prankster can use his quick wit and cruel sense of humor to enrage foes before incapacitating them with a clever turn of phrase.

#This ability replaces fascinate.

#This ability replaces lore master.

Bardic Performance	KEY:Bardic Performance ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A prankster's bardic performance functions like a bard's, but some of its performances are exchanged for those listed below.
Mock				KEY:Mock ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, the prankster can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him. Each creature to be mocked must be within 90 feet, able to see, hear, and understand the prankster, and capable of paying attention to him. The prankster must also be able to see the creatures affected. For every three levels the prankster has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the prankster's level + the prankster's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the prankster cannot successfully mock that creature for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm the prankster. While the prankster maintains the mocking, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully attacked the prankster with a melee or ranged attack, or has harmed the creature with a spell that deals damage. Mock is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. Mock relies on audible and visual components in order to function. This ability replaces fascinate.
Punchline			KEY:Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 6th level, the prankster can use his performance to tell a punchline to amuse a creature he has already mocked (see above), goading it into hideous laughter (as the spell). Using this ability does not disrupt the mock effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the mock effect). A prankster can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Telling a punchline does not count against a prankster's daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modif ier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Punchline is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language dependent ability and relies on audible components. This ability replaces the suggestion ability.
Mass Punchline		KEY:Mass Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:This ability functions just like punchline, but allows a prankster of 18th level or higher to use hideous laughter simultaneously against any number of creatures that he has mocked. This ability replaces the mass suggestion ability.
Swap				KEY:Swap ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A prankster can steal an object from a creature and replace it with another object of the same size or smaller that the prankster has in his hand. This functions as the steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322), but the prankster does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and may use his Sleight of Hand check in place of his combat maneuver check. If the prankster's check exceeds the target's CMD by 10 or more, the target is unaware the swap has been made until it tries to use the swapped object or the end of its next turn (whichever happens first). This ability replaces lore master.

A saboteur has focused his alchemical research toward new ways to conceal his presence, sow confusion, and blow up large structures.

Class Skills			KEY:Class Skills ~ Saboteur	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A saboteur adds Knowledge (engineering) to his list of class skills and removes Knowledge (nature) from his list of class skills.
Chameleon Mutagen			KEY:Chameleon Mutagen ~ Saboteur	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a saboteur discovers how to create a special elixir that he can imbibe in order to heighten his ability to move undetected and his mobility at the cost of his physical might. When consumed, the elixir causes the saboteur's skin to change color to match the background and causes his hands and feet to secrete a sticky residue. This grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to half his alchemist level (minimum +1), as well as granting him a climb speed equal to half his base speed, for 10 minutes per saboteur level. In addition, while the chameleon extract is in effect, the saboteur takes a -2 penalty to his Strength. This ability replaces mutagen. A saboteur who drinks an alchemist's mutagen is treated as a non-alchemist. All limitations to mutagens apply to chameleon mutagen as if it were the same ability. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to the chameleon mutagen.

Bore Bomb*				KEY:Discovery ~ Bore Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he may choose to make it a bore bomb. If a bore bomb strikes a wall, gate, siege engine, or similar large, solid, inanimate structure, it ignores half the target's hardness and deals 1 point of damage per saboteur level. If a bore bomb reduces an inanimate target to half its hit points or fewer, it blows a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the target.
Complex Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Complex Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he can choose to have it modif ied by two different discoveries that modify a bomb's damage (those discoveries marked with an asterisk). Each discovery modif ies half the bomb's damage dice, rounding down. For example, a concussive/frost bomb from a 9th-level saboteur deals 2d4 points of sonic damage + 2d6 points of frost damage. Creating a complex bomb counts as 2 daily uses of the bomb ability.

	DESC:While all witches commune with the unknown, the blend of human ingenuity and adept learning mixed with elven blood gives some half-elves a unique conduit to channel the powers of the arcane. Bonded witches forsake familiars as vessels of power in favor of a specific object that grants them powers above and beyond those of their patron alone, as they tap into the powerful magic of the item itself. A bonded witch has the following class features.

# COMMENT: Need to implement
# COMMENT: I've broken it down to Items, but we need to make this a choice and grant properly
Bonded Item	KEY:Bonded Item ~ Bonded Witch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard's arcane bond bonded item (Core Rulebook 78), and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions. A bonded witch's bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way (Advanced Player's Guide 68), but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item. Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch's bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch's level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way. She can cast any one of these spells once per day using her bonded object, but gains greater f lexibility in what spells she can cast, and gains more powerful spells as she gains new levels. The bonded item spells associated with each item type are as follows.

In addition, the alchemist gains fast healing 1 as long as he is in an area of bright light (such as sunlight or inside the area of a daylight spell). This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the greater mutagen discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that still grants a +4 natural armor bonus, and also grants a +4 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score and a +2 bonus to a second physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, but his fast healing increases to 3 as long as he is in an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the greater mutagen discovery and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the grand mutagen discovery can brew a dendrite mutagen that now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +2 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's fast healing increases to 5 as long as he is within an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the grand mutagen discovery and replaces that ability.

The bramble brewer's gains fast healing 10, but instead of only gaining fast healing in bright light, this fast healing persists in areas of bright or normal light. A bramble brewer must possess the grand mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.

Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow's favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.

Blood Feast		KEY:Blood Feast ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has. At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer. This ability replaces the summon monster I, III, V, VII, and IX spell-like abilities.
Bloody Gift		KEY:Bloody Gift ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.
Avatar Gambit	KEY:Avatar Gambit ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.
Rage Power		KEY:Rage Power ~ Blood God Disciple		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level and 15th level, a blood god disciple selects a barbarian rage power, which he may use when raging (whether from the avatar gambit ability or actual barbarian rage).

This ability works identically to the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the hateful rager selects another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type, as described in the ranger class. While raging, the hateful rager makes every effort to fight a favored enemy rather than other opponents. If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way). She can avoid harmful obstacles normally in her attempts to reach the target and is not forced to take the shortest route. This ability replaces the barbarian's rage power gained at 2nd level. At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, in place of a rage power she gains another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type.

Her caster level for this ability is equal to her paladin level. Rather than assigning a mission or task, the redeemer gives the creature a simple set of prohibitions to protect others. Example geas include "Leave this city and do not return" or "Do not attack caravans." The prohibition must be against an area no larger than 300 square miles or one specific group of people (such as a tribe or citizens of a particular city). This ability lasts 1 month per paladin level. This replaces aura of resolve.

Quicker than the Eye	KEY:Quicker than the Eye ~ Filcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a filcher develops an amazingly swift and delicate touch. When she uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher's class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal -20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.
Rummage			KEY:Rummage ~ Filcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a filcher learns how to assess the value of items at the quickest glance. She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers. She gains a +1 bonus on Appraise checks and an additional +1 bonus every three levels thereafter. As a swift action, a filcher can make an Appraise check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of ). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a -20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see. This ability replaces trap sense +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6.
Filch				KEY:Filch ~ Filcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 4th level, a filcher learns how pluck items off her opponents even in combat. She gains Improved Steal (Advanced Player's Guide 163) as a bonus feat and can use her Sleight of Hand bonus instead of her CMB when performing a steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322). If the filcher gains bonuses on combat maneuver checks from any feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, they are added to the Sleight of Hand bonus when using the steal maneuver. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
Superior Filching		KEY:Superior Filching ~ Filcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 8th level, a filcher becomes a master at separating owners from their property.

See Sin (Sp)	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:At 3rd level, a purifier gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her oracle level on Sense Motive checks to sense enchantments, which she can make as a full-round action. She also gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her oracle level on Spellcraft checks to identify enchantment school spells and spells with the curse or emotion descriptor (see page 251 of Ultimate Magic for spells in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and Advanced Player's Guide that have the curse or emotion descriptor).
Celestial Armor (Su)	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:At 7th level, a purifier's armor takes on a golden or silvery sheen and becomes light as a feather. Her armor weighs half as much as long as she wears it, and she also gains armor training as a fighter 4 levels lower than her oracle level. At 11th level, a purifier gains heavy armor proficiency.
Sin Eater (Su)	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:At 11th level, a purifier can consume a curse, enchantment, or emotion effect by touch as a fullround action. She can do this a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier, and must make a Charisma check with a bonus equal to her oracle level against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect (or the Hit Dice of the creator for a supernatural effect). If the check succeeds, the effect is negated; however, the purifier is sickened for 1d4 rounds. If the target is possessed (such as by a magic jar effect or a ghost's malevolence ability), the possessor is forced out on a successful check. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the possessor is sickened for 2d4 rounds.
Sacred Scourge (Su)	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:At 5th level, a purifier may channel holy power to harm evil outsiders as a cleric of her level using the Alignment Channel feat. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.

Touch of Serenity (Su)	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:At 1st level, a tranquil guardian gains Touch of Serenity (Advanced Player's Guide 172) as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, and every six levels thereafter, the duration of a tranquil guardian's Touch of Serenity increases by 1 round. Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new Will save to end the effect. The duration does not stack; only the longest remaining duration applies. This ability replaces smite evil.
Serene Strike (Su)	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:At 3rd level, when a tranquil guardian confirms a critical hit, she may convert all damage from her attack to nonlethal damage, and when she does, she can activate Touch of Serenity through her weapon or unarmed strike.

Waves of Peace (Su)	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:At 11th level, a tranquil guardian may expend 2 uses of her Touch of Serenity to affect each opponent within 5 feet of her with that effect. She does not need to touch the creature for the effect to take hold. This ability replaces aura of justice.
Apostle of Peace (Su)	SOURCEPAGE:p.87		DESC:At 20th level, a tranquil guardian's DR increases to 10/evil, and whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal, she heals the maximum possible amount.

If it fails this save, the attack (including spells or special abilities) automatically fails. This ability replaces holy champion.
