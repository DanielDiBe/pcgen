VARIANT BANDERSNATCHES
Though no bandersnatch is ordinary, some are
rarer than others. The most famous
is the frumious bandersnatch,
brimming with rage so fierce it
burns. Variant bandersnatches
may combine two or more
of the abilities below.
Confounding Bandersnatch (+1 CR): Confounding
bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their
quills and Claws. Poison (Ex) Claws and quills-injury;
save Fort DC 29
frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes
effect
confused for 1 minute
cure 2 consecutive saves. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Frumious Bandersnatch (+2 CR): A frumious
bandersnatch seethes with barely repressed rage and anger.
If it misses with its Bite attack or falls below half of its hit
points, it succumbs to such uncontrollable fury that it bursts
into f lame. While engulfed in these f lames, a frumious
bandersnatch is affected as by a haste spell (this effect
cannot be dispelled) and causes an additional 2d6 points
of fire damage with each of its melee attacks and its quill
defense ability. The fury lasts for 5 rounds, after which the
bandersnatch cannot enter a fury again for another 5 rounds.
A frumious bandersnatch has fire resistance 30.
Lesser Bandersnatch (-4 CR): Smaller or younger
bandersnatches are still fearsome predators in their
own right. A lesser bandersnatch is Huge, with 4 fewer
Hit Dice than a typical bandersnatch. Reduce its physical
ability scores by 4 each and its Wisdom and Charisma by
2 each. A lesser bandersnatch lacks quick recovery and
deals 1d8+4 points of damage with its quill defense and
pain abilities. Lesser bandersnatches never have any
additional variant powers.
Magicbane Bandersnatch (+3 CR): These bandersnatches
radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should
the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a
free action on the bandersnatch's next turn. Magicbane
bandersnatches lack gaze and quick recovery.
Primal Bandersnatch (+2 CR): Primal bandersnatches
have kept their ties to the ancient world of the fey.
They have the extraplanar subtype,
SR equal to 11 plus their CR, 
	DR:10/
cold iron, and the advanced creature
simple template.

Crystallize (Ex) A creature entrapped by a
carnivorous crystal's attack must succeed at a
DC 22 Fortitude save each round or become
helpless. If a helpless creature fails this save,
it becomes petrified as its body crystallizes. In
1d4 hours, the petrified victim shatters and a new
carnivorous crystal emerges from the remains.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Razor Sharp (Ex) A carnivorous crystal's Slam attack
deals devastating piercing and slashing damage,
and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.
Subsonic Hum (Su) An active carnivorous crystal
gives off supernatural sonic vibrations. Any
living creature starting its turn within
this aura must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be
stunned for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves
cannot be affected by the same carnivorous crystal's
subsonic hum for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting
effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Natives of the endless caverns of the Plane of Earth,
carnivorous crystals normally lead quiet existences,
subsiSting on minerals leeched from the surrounding
rock. Living creatures, however, provide a veritable feast,
as devouring the minerals in their bones and blood
allows a crystal to reproduce in mere hours instead of
years. Though lacking in anything that could be called
intelligence, carnivorous crystals sense the living, and
hunger for the sustenance trapped within their bodies.
On the Plane of Earth and in the deepest caverns of
the Material Plane, ancient carnivorous crystals grow
without bounds, reaching incredible sizes.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A caryatid column
is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
that allows spell resistance. In addition,
certain spells and effects function differently
against the creature, as noted below.
. A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points
of damage per caster level to a caryatid
column, with no saving throw.
. Transmute mud to rock immediately heals
any and all damage currently suffered by a
caryatid column.
. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change
the column's structure but negates its damage
reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round.
Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character
strikes a caryatid column with a weapon
(magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes
3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's
hardness normally. Weapons that take
any amount of damage in excess of their
hardness gain the broken quality.
Statue (Ex) A caryatid column can
stand perfectly still, emulating a
statue (usually one that is holding
up the ceiling, like a carved
column). An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception
check to notice the caryatid column is alive. If a caryatid
column initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus
on its initiative check.
Caryatid columns are the lesser cousins of true golems,
constructs created by spellcasters to guard objects or areas.
Unlike true golems, caryatid columns cannot be made
into shield guardians, but they are often used in greater
numbers because of their relatively inexpensive creation
cost. Each caryatid column is programmed to guard an
object or area when created, and once set, this command
cannot be changed. Caryatid columns are often given
specific parameters concerning whom to ignore and whom
to attack, but since they have no special form of
detection, such restrictions can be overcome
with disguises if the parameters are known.
A caryatid column stands 7 feet tall and
weighs 1,500 pounds. Caryatid columns are always
equipped with a masterwork weapon that appears to
be made out of stone as long as the construct remains
in statue form. The weapon can be recovered after
a caryatid column has been defeated. Arming
a caryatid column with magical weapons is
expensive but feasible-even the most powerful
of magic weapons appear as nothing more than
stone when held by a caryatid column. Since a
weapon held in this manner does not radiate
magic, many use this trait as a method to
hide potent or powerful weapons from both
casual observation and study via detect magic.
True seeing reveals such disguised weapons for
what they really are. Often, only particularly
powerful caryatid columns (typically those with
advanced Hit Dice, but rarely those made much
larger than
	SIZE:M
	size) are entrusted with the
care and protection of such weapons. Of course,
the constructs themselves make full use of any
magic weapons they are given to guard.
CONSTRUCTION
A caryatid column's body is carved from a single
2,000-pound block of stone, such as granite or
marble. The stone must be of exceptional quality,
and costs 2,000 gp.

1 chief of 6th level plus 6-12 cheetahs or leopards)
Treasure NPC gear (studded leather armor, longbow with 20

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cat's Luck (Ex) Once per day when a catfolk makes a
Reflex saving throw, it can roll the saving throw twice
and take the better result. It must decide to use this
ability before the saving throw is attempted.
Sprinter (Ex) A catfolk gains a 10-foot racial bonus
to its speed when using the charge, run, or
withdraw actions.
Most catfolk are tribal hunter-gatherers
who dwell in harmony with nature, though some
tribes have acclimated well to urban environments. As
a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They
like belonging to and being at harmony with a group
whose members work together to accomplish their needs
and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable
societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council
of elevated subchiefs. A tribe's chief is usually the most
competent (and magically talented) member of that tribe.
Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is
expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk
have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange
eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of
pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might
label unwise. Most individual catfolk like to be the center
of attention, but not at the cost of group cohesion.
CATFOLK CHARACTERS
Catfolk have no racial Hit Dice, gaining their capabilities
from class levels. All catfolk have the following racial traits.
+2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Catfolk are
agile and amiable, but they are known for their lack of
common sense and self-control.
Low-Light Vision: In dim light, catfolk can see twice
as far as humans.
Cat's Luck: See above.
Sprinter: See above.
Natural Hunter: Catfolk receive a +2 racial bonus on
Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks.
Languages: Catfolk speak Catfolk
and Common. A catfolk who
has a high Intelligence score
can choose from the following
bonus languages: Elven, Gnoll,
Gnome, Goblin,
Half ling, Orc,
and Sylvan.

AKVAN PRINCES
As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies,
many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind,
targeting members of that race with particular passion.
Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in
slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who
blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them
into akvan princes.
Each akvan prince dedicates itself to
extinguishing a particular type of genie and
gains special abilities with which to slaughter
genies of that type. An
akvan prince gains an
additional 4-8 Hit Dice,
a +4 bonus to three
ability scores, and has a
	CR:of 22- 24.
The akvan prince also gains one of the
following sets of abilities, depending
on what type of genies it hunts.
Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting
akvan prince shatters the strongest
stone. It gains the stone glide ability,
tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow
speed of 100 feet, and its natural
attacks are treated as adamantine
for the purposes of overcoming
damage reduction. It also gains
the following spell-like abilities:
3/day-quickened stone shape,
transmute mud to rock,
transmute rock to mud, wish.
Dying Ember: An efreethating
akvan prince holds
dominion over flame.
It gains resist fire 30, an
efreeti's heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when
grappling or grappled), and the following spell-like
abilities: at will-quickened quench, scorching ray,
wall of fire
3/day-wish.
Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains
power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the
whirlwind ability, its f ly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect
maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like
abilities: at will-invisibility
3/day-gaseous form, wish.
Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and
poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid's
water's fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds
and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like
abilities: constant-water breathing, water walk
at will-
quickened control water
3/day-horrid wilting, wish.
Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads
failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity
20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will-ethereal
jaunt, invisibility
3/day-insanity, mage's disjunction, wish.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Deflect Rays (Su) Once per round as an immediate action, a
sepid can use its Deflect Arrows feat to deflect a ray or a
spell that uses a ranged touch attack.
Rain of Debris (Su) Three times per day as a standard action,
a sepid can call forth a hail of stones, wood,
metal, and similar debris. The debris
rains down and pelts all creatures
in a 10-foot-high, 40-foot-radius
cylinder centered on the
sepid, dealing 15d6 points of
bludgeoning damage (Reflex
DC 25 for half ). This attack
does not harm the sepid, and
counts as an evil attack for the
purpose of damage reduction. The
save DC is Constitution-based.
Warlords among the divs,
sepids spread fear, slaughter,
and despair wherever they pass.
They foster battles,
incite rebellions, and
seek heroes to slay,
destroying all that which
gives common people
hope. With their falchions
in hand, sepids often stand
at the fore of the foul legions
they raise.
Sepids delight in twiSting the
truth, but while all divs are
liars, sepids make themselves
predictable by always
doing the opposite
of what they claim,
and wise opponents
turn this knowledge to their
own advantage.
Sepids stand 13 feet
tall and weigh upward
of 1,500 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Consume Essence (Su) A shira's
deadliest attacks drain away a portion of its victim's
essence. Whenever a shira hits with a coup de grace attack
using its Bite, or confirms a critical hit with its Claws or
Bite, the target must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save
or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain. The save is
Constitution-based.
Dusty Pelt (Ex) A shira collects and produces copious amounts
of dust and ash within the coarse hairs of its furry hide. As
a move action, it can shake itself, creating a cloud of dust
that fills its space, providing it concealment. Any attack that
deals at least 10 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
damage to the shira (before DR) automatically activates
this ability. The dust cloud lasts for 1 round. A light wind
disperses this cloud immediately.
Bestial stalkers, shiras live to hunt and feed. Resembling
anthropomorphic lionesses, these divs use their powerful
builds, keen senses, and deadly instincts to track the
proudest mortals and slay the most formidable foes. They
embody the deadly nature of the wilds and the dispassion
with which beast and land might turn against mortals,
delighting in proving to civilized beings how small and
helpless they are in the face of a savage world.
Shiras prefer hunting alone, keeping company with
even others of their own kind only long enough to form
temporary hunting bands. With a hunger for intelligent
prey, they savor the taste of mortal souls, savaging
not just victims' bodies but also their vital
essences. Despite being the most feral of
all divs, shiras sometimes serve as
scouts and assassins for div hordes.
Such arrangements usually prove
to be temporary, however, laSting
only until the shiras' savage
instincts or lust for the hunt
again takes hold.
Shiras never go after
an easy kill, and instead
target the most obviously
powerful of the possible
targets. When acting on
this compulsion, a shira
weighs its chances for
survival and the glory of
its intended kill, planning
its tactics carefully and not
necessarily charging savagely
forth. Though savage, a shira is also
a cunning hunter and might wait
weeks for the perfect opportunity
to bring down its chosen prey.
Most shiras stand 10 feet tall and weigh approximately
1,200 pounds.

An eidolon is usually tied to a summoner who forges an
unbreakable link with a being not of his world, calling
upon it and sending it back to its otherworldly home as he
needs. When a summoner dies, this link is destroyed and the
eidolon is banished back from whence it came. Occasionally,
however, this link between eidolon and summoner is
unnaturally severed, usually as a result of powerful magic or
some bizarre death, freeing the eidolon upon the world. Few
can predict what specific events might cause an eidolon to
become unfettered, but those that do become stranded on a
plane alien to them, released to act as they please. An eidolon
that loses its link to its summoner loses its link to its home
realm, and many unfettered eidolons go mad, the glowing
runes that once represented their bonds burning painful
scars onto their bodies. Unfettered eidolons are not quite as
powerful as normal eidolons, but without their evolutions
tied to their summoners' whims, these bizarre and varied
creatures continue to evolve and advance on their own.
CREATING AN UNFETTERED EIDOLON
Unfettered eidolons can take on many shapes and sizes.
The stats presented here are for a
	SIZE:M
	unfettered
eidolon with the serpentine base form and 15 evolution
points, but an eidolon can take almost any form. An
unfettered eidolon has one of four base forms: aquatic,
biped, quadruped, or serpentine. Each base form
determines an eidolon's speed, good and bad saves, and
ability scores, and allots 5 evolution points to starting
evolutions (the bonuses from these starting evolutions
are already factored into the starting STATISTICS

An unfettered eidolon begins with 1 Hit Die, a +2
natural armor bonus, and the evasion ability. As an
unfettered eidolon's Hit Dice increase (see Evolution
Points, below), it gains additional bonuses and abilities.
At 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD thereafter, an unfettered
eidolon's base armor bonus increases by +2. This bonus
may be split between an armor bonus and a natural
armor bonus. Also at 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD
thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to both its
Strength and Dexterity scores. At 5 Hit Dice, and every 4
HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to any one
of its ability scores. At 7 Hit Dice, an unfettered eidolon
gains Multiattack as a bonus feat.
Evolution Points
Unfettered eidolons have a number of evolution points
(EP) you can use to purchase abilities and defenses in
addition to those presented above. An unfettered eidolon
starts with 8 EP, regardless of its base form. For each
additional EP spent beyond 8, an unfettered eidolon's Hit
Dice increase by 1. An unfettered eidolon's
	CR:increases
with its Hit Dice, as outlined on Table 1-2 on page 291
of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary using the "outsider" line.
Many of these abilities are universal monster rules
detailed starting on page 292 of this book.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Panpipes (Su) Three times per day, a faun can use its
masterwork panpipes to augment its spell-like abilities.
Doing so is a swift action that increases the DC of the next
spell-like ability it uses on its turn by +2.
Often mistaken for satyrs, fauns are far more benevolent
than their unpredictable cousins. Many people use the
two names interchangeably, a fact that irritates both
fauns and satyrs. The vast majority of fauns are male,
although unlike satyrs, females of this species do exist-
they're simply less common than male fauns.
While satyrs breeding with their seduced victims always
produce full-blooded satyrs, fauns are the result of a willing
pairing between satyrs and goodly fey or kindhearted
humanoids such as humans or elves. Even in this case, the
babies of such unions are usually stolen away and raised by
their fey parent or some other sylvan foster family.
Like satyrs, fauns enjoy wine, music, dancing,
nature, and carnal pleasures. Gentle hedonists, fauns
also have a dedicated connection to the countryside,
helping hardworking humanoids who make peace with
the land and take little more than they need. They help
these frontier folk by fighting off significant threats
and keeping less savory fey creatures away from their
settlements. While they prefer to go unnoticed, in dire
times a band of fauns may present themselves to villagers
to warn their neighbors of an upcoming threat.
Fauns find nymphs exceptionally attractive, more so
than all others who dare view them. Nymphs find beauty
in fauns' good nature and steadfast dedication to the
natural world, and often humor their advances before
almost accidentally falling in love with them.
As tall as a human, a faun stands on stark white goat
legs and has short horns protruding from its head. It also
has a short tail that swishes playfully when it is excited
or entertained, and its hair falls
gracefully around its horns
and ears. Its humanoid
torso is always lithe but
chiseled because of its
constant activity and
play-fauns rarely
laze about too
long. Fauns stand
nearly 6 feet tall and
weigh little more
than 150 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Charging Trip (Ex) A festrog that hits with its Bite after
making a charge attack on all fours can attempt to trip its
opponent (+4 bonus). This trip does not provoke attacks
of opportunity.
Diseased Pustules (Ex) When a festrog takes damage from
a piercing or slashing weapon, some of its boils rupture,
squirting the attacker with puslike fluids. The noxious
secretions carry a potent contact disease that causes those
infected to break out into painful necrotic boils.
Necrotic Boils: Disease-contact
save Fort DC 11
onset 1
day
frequency 1/day
effect 1d4 Con
cure 1 save.
Feed (Su) Every time a festrog makes a successful Bite attack,
it feeds on its opponent's flesh and gains 5 temporary hit
points. The festrog cannot have more than 5 temporary hit
points gained by this ability at one time.
Four-Footed Run (Ex) A festrog can run on all fours at speed
of 50 feet if it doesn't hold or carry anything in its hands.
When running on all fours, it is treated as if it had the
Run feat.
A festrog is an undead abomination spawned when a
creature is killed by a massive release of negative energy
(perhaps due to planar bleeding, the destruction of a
potent artifact, or even certain magical attacks by powerful
undead), and then mutilated by an outside force, such as
the scavenging of wild animals. Sometimes called dogghouls
for their ability to run on all fours, the name often
causes opponents to misinterpret this creature's abilities
and grossly underestimate its intelligence, for the festrog
is in fact a rather canny monstrosity.
Festrogs inhabit remote areas near places where they
were slain. It's not uncommon for a tribe of festrogs to
share territories with ghouls. Most festrogs gather in small
bands, based on whatever loose affiliations they might
recall from when they were alive, and choose dwellings
in sunless areas easily defended with group tactics. Like
ghouls, they tend to skulk about graveyards, though they
prefer ones with tombs and mausoleums so they can
hide during the day. They hunt nocturnally in packs,
preferring open areas like plains, farmlands, or open
forests where they can track down prey with few places for
it to run or hide. These packs wander seminomadically,
often traveling miles beyond their dwellings in pursuit of
mortal f lesh.

Fey creatures resemble the mundane creatures they derive
from, but with brighter colors, delicate features, and elegant
wings such as those of a pixie or sprite. Despite their fragileseeming
appearance, fey creatures are every bit as hardy as
their non-fey relations, though they sacrifice raw might for
grace and the ability to f ly. They live long lives, barring death
by misadventure, and rarely show outward signs of age.
Some fey creatures owe their nature to fey ancestors
interbreeding with mortal beings, while others are races in
their own right. Still others began life as ordinary creatures
and were infused with fey essence through the magic of
learned spellcasters or the inf luence of ancient powers of
nature. As a rule, fey creatures rarely dwell in civilized lands,
both by preference and because the conditions that give
rise to the fey rarely occur in urban surroundings. If not
already born into realms of primeval wild or areas touched
by great fey powers, fey creatures soon seek them out.
Though more prone to mischief than mayhem, fey
creatures run the gamut from inimical to sprightly in
behavior. Those inclined toward play and jest take a dim
view of interlopers lacking in good humor. Such foultempered
intruders risk humiliation at best if they insult
the fey, and much worse if they raise arms against them.
More aggressive fey still possess a well-developed though
sadistic sense of humor. Such wicked fey use their inborn
powers to lure outsiders to their doom, rather than into
mere inconvenience.
Fey creatures generally have cordial relationships with
animals, allies of nature such as druids, and other fey.
Exceptions exist where rival communities of fey dwell in
proximity to one another. In these cases, any fey creatures
in the vicinity ally with one side or the other according
to their own inclinations, only rarely standing outside such
conf licts. Fey creatures derived from horses and the like
often serve as mounts, though only to other fey or to allies
of nature who acknowledge them as at least near-equals, if
not full partners.

Armor Class: Reduce the creature's natural armor, if
any, by 1 (minimum of 0).
Defensive Abilities: A fey creature gains a +4 bonus
on saves against mind-affecting effects, resist cold and
electricity 10, and 	DR:5/cold iron (if 11 HD or less) or 	DR:10/
cold iron (if 12 HD or more).
Speed: Unless the base creature f lies better, the fey
creature f lies at 1-1/2 times the base creature's land speed

maneuverability of good, it increases to perfect.
Special Abilities: A fey creature gains one of the
following abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof.

Camouf lage (Ex) A fey creature can use Stealth to hide
in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not
grant cover or concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on
Stealth checks. This bonus does not stack with any racial
Stealth bonus possessed by the base creature.
Change Shape (Su) A fey creature can change shape into
a single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen
of its base creature, a humanoid creature within one size
category, or an animal within one size category. In all
cases, the fey creature appears as the same individual of
its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type
of polymorph spell used should be chosen as appropriate
based on the alternate form, such as alter self for taking
humanoid form. This ability can be selected more than
once, granting an additional form each time.
Energy Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains resistance 10
to one energy type, or increases an exiSting resistance by
10. Resistance increased beyond 30 becomes immunity
instead. This ability can be selected more than once.
Evasion (Ex) A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue
ability of the same name.
Long Step (Su) A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet
per Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once
every 1d4 rounds.
Spell Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 +
its CR. This does not stack with any exiSting SR possessed
by the base creature.
Trackless Step (Ex) A fey creature does not leave a trail in
natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose
to leave a trail, if it so desires.
Vanish (Su) As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for
1 round as if affected by invisibility. It can use this ability for
1 round per day per Hit Die.
Woodland Stride (Ex) A fey
creature can move through
any sort of undergrowth
(such as natural thorns,
briars, overgrown areas, and
similar terrain) at its normal
speed and without taking damage
or suffering any other impairment.
Thorns, briars, and overgrown
areas that have been magically
manipulated to impede
motion still affect it.
Optionally, this ability may
function in a different type
of terrain, to allow the fey
creature to move through,
swamps, rocky areas, ice,
and so forth. Whatever
the choice, this ability
only functions in one
type of terrain. This ability can be selected more than
once, for a different terrain each time.
Spell-Like Abilities: A fey creature with an Intelligence
or Wisdom score of 8 or more has a cumulative number
of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice. Unless
otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster
level equals the creature's HD (or the caster level of the
base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).
HD Abilities
1-2 Dancing lights 3/day, faerie fire
3-4 Entangle, glitterdust

9-10 Confusion
11-12 Feeblemind
13-14 Mislead
15-16 Project image
17-18 Irresistible dance
19-20 Scintillating pattern
Abilities: A fey creature gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity
and a +2 bonus to Intelligence and Charisma. A fey
creature receives a -2 penalty to Strength. Fey creatures
derived from creatures without an Intelligence score gain
an Intelligence of 3.
Skills: A fey creature with racial Hit Dice has skill
points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence
modifier. It gains Acrobatics, Bluff, Fly, and Stealth
as class skills.
Languages: Fey creatures speak Sylvan as well
as any 	AUTO:LANG|spoken by the base creature.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can
excrete a trail of mucus that covers its
space and lasts for 10 minutes. This
mucus comes in two types: slimy and
sticky. A character who attempts to move
through an area covered in
slippery mucus must make
a DC 14 Reflex save each
round or fall prone. Sticky
mucus transforms squares into
difficult terrain. Only one type
of mucus can be in effect at a time
in any one square. Flail snails can move
through either type of slime with ease. A square
of mucus exposed to a fire source dries and reverts to
normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts into its shell
as a swift action, increasing its natural armor
bonus by +6, but it cannot move or
attack while retracted. It can return
to normal as a free action.
Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike
strand up to 60 feet long, and can use this rope to hang itself
and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely,
or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can
climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once
the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes
in 1d4 rounds. While the slime rope exists, other creatures
can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check.
Suction (Ex) A flail snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its
10-foot climb speed applies even to perfectly sheer surfaces
and ceilings, with no chance of the flail snail falling off unless
it is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple.
Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is
an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of
affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail
snail are warped
area effect spells are not affected. If a spell
is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.
1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the
caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to
successfully cast spells.
4-6 Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is
affected as if the spell had been cast on it instead.
7-9 Spell fails. Nothing happens.
10 Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning).
Flail snails are intelligent gastropods that subsist on
fungus, mold, and vermin, though they may attack larger
creatures in self-defense. Known for their magic-warping
shells and club-like tentacles, f lail snails roam slowly
through subterranean caverns writing great epics
in their slime trails.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Injection (Ex) When a flumph strikes an opponent with
its spikes, it injects a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4
points of acid damage immediately and another 1d4 points
of acid damage on the round after the attack. The target can
end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water
for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check.
A creature that grapples or swallows the flumph takes this
acid damage automatically every round it maintains this
contact with a living flumph.
Stench Spray (Ex) A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foulsmelling
liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions
like the stench universal monster ability, except it only
affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make
a DC 10 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The
save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph
can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet.
To use this version of its stench spray, the flumph must
succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If
the target is hit, it must make a DC 10 Fortitude save or
become nauseated for 5 rounds
otherwise, it is sickened for
5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and
on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected
at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can
smell it at double this range).
Come from distant stars to protect unprepared worlds from
cosmic horrors, f lumphs are jellyfish-like creatures that
f loat in the air and hunt with acidic spikes growing from
their undersides. Gentle at heart, f lumphs understand that
their appearance often terrifies viewers, and thus conceal
themselves and observe neighboring settlements from
afar, only revealing themselves when absolutely necessary.
They also know full well the limitations of their fragile
forms, and rather than directly opposing the horrors they
seek to defeat, they prefer to recruit and advise heroes to
tackle these dangerous tasks instead.
Flumphs f loat and speak via a constant f low of air
through tiny pores in their white bodies, emitting a
rhythmic puffing whenever they're aloft. Typical f lumphs
weigh 15 pounds and are 3 feet across. Flumphs deeply
revere dreams, seeing them as omens and portents. While
they normally mate and reproduce on the world of their
birth, f lumphs occasionally engage in a ritual called the
Seeding, in which seed pods are f lung into outer space in
order to provide other planets with guardians.

Foo creatures are benevolent guardian spirits that hail
originally from the Outer Plane of Nirvana, where they
spend their days cavorting in the idyllic wilds or aiding
that realm's inhabitants, particularly the agathions,
in their work. Yet while they come from Nirvana, foo
creatures are often encountered on the Material Plane as
well, for they are favorite conjurations of many cultures
and religions.
Countless species of foo creatures exist-for if an
animal dwells upon the Material Plane, it is certain
that somewhere in the vast wilds of Nirvana its spiritual
double frolics and plays. Nonetheless, certain foo
creatures are more common than others, and the most
often encountered of all are dogs and lions.
A foo creature can be called to the Material Plane for
any reason a conjurer can imagine-these monsters are
generally much more intelligent than their mundane
counterparts, and can not only follow complex orders but
can speak and converse as well. Typically, a foo creature is
contacted to serve for a time as a guardian-by adopting
its statue form using its freeze ability, a foo creature can
appear as little more than an ornate decoration astride
the facade of a building or standing guard over a fountain
in a city plaza. They are not as often called upon to serve
as soldiers in armies, for foo creatures detest war. They
generally dislike serving as mounts as well, although for
particularly pious and kindly folk, they have been known
to make exceptions.

AC: A foo creature's natural armor bonus increases by +2.
Hit Dice: The base creature's racial Hit Dice change

Defensive Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the
base creature's defensive abilities and special qualities. It
also gains the following.
Damage Reduction (Ex): A foo creature gains DR/
bludgeoning based on its Hit Dice. A foo creature with up
to 10 HD gains 	DR:5/bludgeoning. A foo creature with 11
or more HD gains 	DR:10/bludgeoning.
Paired Protectors (Su): When two or more foo creatures
are within 30 feet of one another, they both gain the
benef it of a protection from evil spell. The caster level of
this protection from evil effect is equal to the highest Hit
Dice of the affected foo creatures. This effect can be
dispelled, but if it is, a foo creature can reactivate it as
a swift action.
Stony Defense (Su): A number of times per day equal to its
Hit Dice, a foo creature can harden its skin to unyielding
stone as an immediate action. It gains hardness 8 until
the end of its next turn, but its speed is reduced by 10 feet
for the same duration.
Special Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the base
creature's special attacks and special abilities. It also
gains the following special quality.
Freeze (Ex): A foo creature can hold itself so still it
appears to be a statue. A foo creature that uses freeze can
take 10 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a
stone statue. A foo creature can maintain this position
for as long as it wishes.
Abilities: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence.
Feats: All foo creatures gain Iron Will as a bonus feat.
Languages: All foo creatures speak Common and Celestial.
CREATING AN IMPERIAL FOO
CREATURE
Among foo creatures there exist what are known as
the "imperials"-the leaders of particular races of
foo creatures. Imperial foo creatures are much more
powerful than the typical examples of their kind, and
possess a wide array of additional magical powers. Each
imperial foo creature is a unique entity
only one exists
at any one time. When an imperial foo creature is
slain, the next most powerful foo creature of its
species immediately transcends to this role to
replace the one that was lost.
To create an imperial foo creature, first generate

you'll go through to create the imperial version of
that foo creature are more akin to those you'd go
through to advance a creature by Hit Dice rather
than a standard template.
Step One-Increase Ability Scores: Upon becoming
an imperial, the foo creature gains a +6 bonus to all of
its ability scores, save for Intelligence, which increases to
20 (unless the +6 increase would normally increase its
Intelligence to an even higher score, in which case use that
score instead).
Step Two-Advance Hit Dice: An imperial foo creature
always has at least double the original foo creature's Hit
Dice-you can give the imperial foo creature even more
Hit Dice than this if you want to make a particularly
powerful one. Base attack bonus, saves, skill ranks, feats,
and all other variables dependant upon Hit Dice change
as normal.
Step Three-Increase Size: Increase the foo creature's
size by one category, applying the modifiers for size
changes as summarized on Table 2-2 on page 296 of the
Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.
Step Four-SpellcaSting: An imperial foo creature
casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells
from the cleric list as well as those normally available to
a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for
an imperial foo creature. The imperial foo creature gains
Eschew Materials as a bonus feat, but gains no other class
ability normally granted by the sorcerer class.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A garden ooze excretes digestive acid that can
dissolve flesh. Creatures made of harder materials or plant
matter are immune to the ooze's acid.
Camouflage (Ex) A garden ooze is difficult to spot when it is
at rest among plant growth of any type. A DC 15 Perception
check is required to notice the ooze is a separate entity and
not a diseased portion of the plant it rests upon. The ooze
automatically hits with a Slam against any creature that fails
to notice the ooze and enters its square.
Stink (Ex) Once every 24 hours, a garden ooze can release
foul-smelling gases in a 5-foot-radius spread centered on
the ooze. The ooze usually does so after it is first injured.
The stench of these vapors is overpowering during the first
round it exists, causing living creatures within it to become
sickened for 1d3 rounds (Fort DC 13 negates). This is a
poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
A garden ooze is an animate, acidic mass of
protoplasmic goo that dwells among foliage and
scavenges proteins in the form of carrion or small
animals that blunder into its vicinity. Although
garden oozes are occasionally found in underground
regions near the surface-such as sewers, sinkholes,
and shallow caves-these oozes prefer the outdoors.
One reason for this is that garden oozes are attracted
to large collections of organic material where other tiny
creatures might come to scavenge.
Quick and cunning hunters when compared to most
oozes, garden oozes are particularly dangerous because
they readily attack creatures that wander nearby regardless
of the creatures' size. Oozes that sense prey moving closer
are likely to wait to attack until the potential meal is
within reach. The oozes also give chase when prey f lees.
Garden oozes innately change hue to match the ground
underneath them, so they can be hard to spot.
When a garden ooze attacks, it lashes out with a
whiplike appendage coated with a potent f lesh-eating
acid. If injured, the ooze releases a disguSting stench that
makes it harder to fight off. Further, when one garden
ooze attacks, any other garden oozes nearby join in,
piling on and making escape all but impossible.
Fortunately for larger potential prey, most garden oozes
are quite small, the largest among them reaching 3 feet in
diameter before they split into smaller oozes. These oozes
are also known as rat-catcher oozes or compost oozes, and
some brave gardeners actually encourage the growth of
such oozes in their gardens as a way to combat pests. Once
the pests are under control, however, the oozes themselves
must be hunted and slain before the garden is safe to tend.

charge, it can make a full attack with its natural weapons.
Talon or Wing (Ex) A garuda cannot use its wing attacks while
flying, and cannot use its talon attacks while not flying.
Garudas are noble, birdlike creatures that inhabit rugged
hills. While they remain detached from humanoid
societies, they are impetuous and gallant, often serving
as protectors of nearby communities.
Most garudas stand around 6 feet tall with a wingspan
of 15 feet and weigh approximately 150

Treasure standard
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bloodsense (Su) A ghorazagh notices living creatures within
60 feet just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
Bloodspray (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a ghorazagh can
unleash a 20-foot cone of blood and eldritch enzymes. Any
living creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray must
make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be affected as by the spell
slow. A slowed creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray
a second time must make an additional save or be
paralyzed. These effects last for 2d6 rounds. A ghorazagh
can also consciously alter its enzymes, producing a spray
that removes all effects of this ability. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Chemical Communication (Ex) Ghorazaghs can
communicate with other ghorazaghs within
60 feet via pheromone transmission. In a
ghorazagh hive, this range extends to cover the
entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of
communication that only ghorazaghs can understand.
Ghorazaghs-or Gore weavers-f loat like tumorous
specters through the deepest, most alien cavities of
the lightless underground, preying upon the wretched
vermin of those horrid places. Cunning, with minds
and drives unknowable and obscene to those of lands
above, the Gore weavers only recently became aware of
the fertility and bounty of the surface world and are now
slowly turning their ebon eyes upward.
While ghorazaghs can digest nearly anything, they are
incapable of digeSting blood. Their digestive systems
process f lesh, bone, and all other organic material,
filtering out blood and storing it in large reservoirs
within their bodies, whereupon the blood is mixed
internally with mucus and other strange f luids to form
a thick, gluelike substance. While a ghorazagh can spray
this f luid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of
the foul substance is as a building material. Ghorazagh
hives are constructed entirely of this material, which
when it dries has the strength of metal while retaining
a dark red resinlike appearance. A ghorazagh hive is a
nightmare place as a result-twiSting tunnels with an
eerily organic appearance that can wind for miles on end.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cursed Claws (Ex) A ghul's Claws count as
both cold iron and magic for the purpose
of bypassing damage reduction.
Genie-kin (Ex) For all race-related
effects (such as a ranger's favored
enemy), a ghul is considered a genie
even though its type is undead.
Ghuls are undead jann whose eternal existence was
twisted by fate and wrought through the displeasure of
Ahriman, Lord of the Divs. As if the curse of undeath and
ravenous hunger were not enough, these once-majestic
creatures now bear donkey hooves as feet. Despite their
horrific undead appearance, this feature shames them
the most, and they hide their feet from view.
Ghuls, like ghouls and ghasts, haunt cemeteries and
other places of the dead hoping to feed on corpses. They
also hunt mourners and grave tenders, as they enjoy the
taste of living prey as well as that of the dead. Selective
in their diets, ghuls choose their victims by personality,
believing innocence and youth taste more delicious than
the barely palatable f lesh of the bitter and old. Sometimes
a ghul follows a funeral procession in hyena form,
keeping a safe distance until the ceremony,
whereupon it changes into its true form to
attack and feast. Sorrow and despair taste as
delicious as innocence to a ghul.
While not directly affected by
sunlight, ghuls despise its presence
and only move about during the day if
forced to by necessity. They primarily
hunt at night, sometimes straying
far from their graveyard lairs and
burial caves in search of fresh prey
to sate their hunger.
The longer a ghul goes without
feeding, the more ferocious and
primal the creature becomes. A
well-sated ghul organizes with
others of its kind and lesser
undead, tormenting nearby
towns and settlements. A
ghul involved with this
level of organization
often has a scattered
set of lairs throughout
the desert. These allow
the ghul to strike far from
its home lair and hide again
without having to travel during
the blistering daylight sun.
When a ghul goes for too long
without feeding, it becomes
increasingly feral and violent-

Vermin Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild
empathy ability, save that it works only on vermin. An ash
giant gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice
(+14 for most ash giants). Vermin are normally mindless,
but this empathic communication imparts upon them a
modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the ash giant
to train vermin and use them as guardians (although it does
not grant them skills or feats).
Whether because of disruptive magic, unearthed deep
elements, or alien technology that fell calamitously from
the sky, ash giants are victims of their barren terrains. Yet
they somehow survive and even thrive in these desperate
lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with
the enormous and often mutated vermin they share the
landscape with, and sometimes use the largest of these
creatures as mounts.
Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is
incredibly dark. Killing someone through a prank is just
as funny as tripping a friend while on a hunt. While not
inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by
other tribes have practically bred violence into
their minds.
Ash giants are 10 feet tall
and weigh 1,200 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Axe Wielder (Ex)
All cave giants are
proficient with handaxes,
battleaxes, and greataxes.
Stooped over in a perpetual crouch, cave
giants move as if they had never mastered
walking erect. Their faces mix the worst features
of ogre and feral orc. The largest would measure 10 feet in
height if they ever stood straight. The typical cave giant
weighs 1,000 pounds. Though few survive past 60 years,
cave giants can live as long as 150 years.
While they prove remarkably adept with axes of all
varieties, cave giants lack the patience to work metal. What
metal a cave giant possesses was likely stolen from other
giants or worked by enslaved subterranean smiths.
Slaves such as dwarves, orcs, and troglodytes do most
of the labor in cave giant settlements. Poor treatment
and the need for meat keep slave populations small
and ever-rotating. New slaves are brought in whenever
raiding parties remember to reign in their blood lust. Any
prisoners who fail to submit to their new masters find
themselves served on the dinner table or tossed screaming
into the giant's cave lizard pens.
Giant lizards of all types serve as both guard beasts and
sport for the cave giants. Giant frilled lizards are rarely pets,
as most cave giants opt to keep less dangerous monitor lizards
instead. Kept in check only by fear and brutal beatings, such
pets turn on their handlers at the first sign of weakness. At
feeding time, live captives are tossed into the
pens, a festive event filled with boisterous
cheers and spirited betting.

Sandwalking (Ex) A desert giant travels at full
speed across sand, rocky ground, or dust, and leaves
no trail behind unless it chooses to.
Scimitar Training (Ex) All desert giants are proficient with
scimitars, and can wield them as if they were light weapons.
A desert giant adds its full Strength bonus to attacks made
with a scimitar wielded in its off hand, and gains a +4 bonus
to CMD versus disarm and sunder attempts when fighting
with a scimitar in each hand.
Desert giants rove the stark and majestic sands, rarely
dwelling in permanent camps. They roam from oasis to
oasis, sleeping beneath the stars or in easily dismantled
yurts, breaking camp as whim strikes or when food
sources grow scarce.
Desert giants stand 15 feet tall on average, but have slender
builds and rarely weigh more than 2,000 pounds, a fact that
greatly contributes to their grace and speed. The giants favor
loose robes with keffiyehs for protection from the scouring
desert winds, as well as traveling leathers worn beneath
the robes. They require little water, and are able to survive
for as long as 2 weeks on food alone. When such goods are
available, they drink water, milk, and juices in prodigious
amounts, but they spurn beer, wine, and stronger spirits.
The bulk of their diet comes from figs, olives, and similar
bounty of the oases, supplemented by meat if required. The
eldest desert giants live as long as 300 years.
Despite their nomadic ways, desert giants guard their
territory fiercely, driving away all interlopers, whether
intelligent or bestial.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Archery Expert (Su) A jungle giant is proficient with all bows, and
does not provoke an attack of opportunity when firing a bow
in melee combat.
Spell Storing (Su) Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle
giant can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used
against it, negating the effects against it but not against
any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to
1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire.
If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee
or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a
free action, as if it were using a spell storing weapon. This
spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This
discharges the stored spell.
Warding Tattoos (Su) A jungle giant's magical tattoos grant it
a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this
bonus if it wears armor.
Reclusive by nature, jungle giants lair deep within the
rainforest. These giants distrust the ways of civilization
and resent trespassers. More than one vine-covered lost
city in the deep jungle owes its fall to jungle giant ire.
The warrior-women of these tribes usually fight with
bows, sacred weapons often passed down over generations
from mother to daughter. To touch a jungle giant's bow
without permission is a mortal insult.
Jungle giants stand 17 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds.
Their barklike skin bears runic brands etched into each
giant as a rite of passage into adulthood. Jungle giant
tribes are matriarchal, ruled by an elder female warrior.
Males traditionally defend
the village, gather food,
tend livestock, and raise
children.

A girtablilu gains a racial

+10). Scorpions are normally
mindless, but this empathic communication imparts
upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing
girtablilus to train scorpions and use them as guardians
(though it does not grant them skills or feats).
Girtablilus fiercely guard ancient places and treasures lost
to history. Far from civilized eyes, they thrive and piously
protect their charges with the aid of monstrously large
scorpions that girtablilus keep as pets.
All girtablilus share a zeal for religion, although the objects
of veneration vary from tribe to tribe. Some girtablilu tribes
still serve long-forgotten deities, preserving the divinities'
names and holy rituals. Others embrace religions derived
from prehistoric worship, devoted to the idea of gods that
once were or might never have been.
Girtablilu leaders are clerics or oracles, and are responsible
for the tribe's religious observances and laws. Tradition
and service to the group are important. Those who violate
tribal beliefs are killed or exiled into the harsh wasteland.
Girtablilus believe that no sacrifice in life (including death
in the service of the gods) goes unrewarded in the hereafter;
this belief makes them fierce and fearless fighters.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Ex) When a globster eats
a living creature, it only digests a
small portion of the remains. As the
undigested remains accumulate inside
of it, the globster grows more and
more bloated. As a full-round action that
does not provoke attacks of opportunity,
a globster can regurgitate these foul
remains along with portions of its own
mass. Doing so causes the globster
1d6 points of damage, but creates
a new, fully grown globster that
immediately attacks the nearest
non-globster target. A globster
can create spawn up to once per day,
though only after it has fed upon at
least four Medium-sized creatures
(or the equivalent number of
creatures of other sizes).
Decompose (Ex) A slain globster
decays into a mass of goo in
the span of 24 hours. However, the
corpse retains the creature's stench aura for 1d10 days after
its death.
Nausea (Ex) Any creature struck by a globster must make a DC
18 Fortitude save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. Once
a creature makes this saving throw, it is immune to further
nausea effects from that particular globster for 24 hours. This
is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
A globster is a living collection of half-digested parts from
large sea creatures such as whales and squid. Passersby
usually discover it by smell long before they see it. Many
unfortunate folk who happen upon a globster mistake it
for the carcass of a beached sea animal, getting too close
before discovering the seemingly dead creature is very
much alive. For a time, sages believed globsters were
undead-that they were simply undulating wads of rotting
f lesh animated with a drive to feed. However, globsters are
actually living creatures.
Globsters usually wash up on a beach or f loat to the shore
to feed on terrestrial stock for a few hours before returning
to the safety of water. Some say the tides and phases of the
moon are to blame for the times globsters come to land to
feed. Globsters reproduce by mixing parts of their own foul
bodies with the poorly digested remains of their meals.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Goblin Breath (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a
goblin snake can release a disguSting belch
as a standard action. Any creature within
5 feet of the goblin snake must succeed
at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened
for 1d6 rounds by the stench. Creatures
that successfully save cannot be affected
by the same goblin snake's goblin breath
for 24 hours. Goblin snakes and goblins
are immune to this effect. This is a poison
effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Snake Empathy (Ex) This ability functions similarly
to a druid's wild empathy ability,
but allows a goblin snake
to verbally communicate
with and be understood by
snakes and similar serpentine
reptiles. The bonus equals the
goblin snake's racial Hit
Dice plus its Charisma
modifier and a +4
racial bonus.
Tenacious predators and bullies, goblin snakes are shrill,
impulsive, and endlessly hungry. When their instinctual
cunning takes hold, however, these maniacal creatures
exhibit all the stealth and deadly cunning of serpents
coupled with the capricious destructiveness of goblins.
Cruel and selfish, goblin snakes care for little more
than their next meals and indulging their unfounded
arrogance. Like goblins, they can easily eat their body
weight in food daily, but goblin snakes are also lazy, and
are more likely to settle for easy meals rather than ones
they must work to find. As a result, goblins snakes eat
almost anything within reach and readily available, from
carrion to rubbish (the source of their horrendous and
nauseating breath). Goblin snakes delight in fresh meat,
but strongly prefer having others bring it to them over
hunting and killing it themselves.
Enjoying the company of snakes, goblin snakes are often
accompanied by several smaller venomous serpents, which
the goblin snakes use to protect their lairs and supplement
their food supply. Goblin snakes are exceedingly jealous
of nagas, however, envying their serpentine majesty and
mastery of magic. Enterprising and cunning goblin snakes
have been known to impersonate nagas, demanding tribute
and food from gullible creatures in awe of the "naga's"
supposed magical abilities. Some scholars have noted the
superficial similarities between goblin snakes and nagas,
and have gone as far as to theorize that the goblin snake
might be a particularly weak breed of naga-a theory that
most nagas do not appreciate at all.
Although goblin snakes are not as smart as
goblins, their terrifying shape allows them
to take positions of inf lated prominence
within goblin society. Fearful goblins
typically defer to the beasts, which
well suits the goblin snakes' innate
arrogance and sense of superiority.
Goblin snakes affiliated with goblin
tribes usually treat their goblin
associates as servants at best and
slaves at worst.
Goblin snakes share goblins' fear of horses
(who could easily step on and crush an
unwary goblin snake) and love of fire
(though their lack of arms gives them little
opportunity to indulge in arson), but they
are not as superstitious as goblins. Goblin
snakes eagerly embrace magic if given the
opportunity, and it is not uncommon
for a goblin snake with adept,
cleric, oracle, or sorcerer
class levels to serve as a
goblin tribe's shaman
or high priest.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bone Prison (Ex) As a standard
action, a bone golem can throw
some of its bones at a creature
within 30 feet-it must make
a ranged touch attack to
hit. These bones magically
duplicate and form a cage
surrounding struck creatures.
Each round, the cage makes a
combat maneuver check to deal
the golem's Slam damage, using the golem's
CMB. If the check fails, the target is still trapped but
takes no damage. The target can escape the grapple normally,
or can break out of the bones by dealing 15 points of damage to
the prison, which has the same AC, DR, and saves as the bone
golem itself. Damage to the prison has no effect on the golem.
The golem can only have one bone prison active at a
time. If it wishes to create a second one, it (or some
other creature) must first destroy the exiSting one.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A bone golem is immune
to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
resistance. In addition, certain spells and
abilities function differently against the
creature, as noted below.
. Magical effects that heal living creatures slow a bone golem
(as the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save).
. A magical attack that deals negative energy damage breaks any
slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3
points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the healing
would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it
gains any excess as temporary hit points. A bone golem gets no
saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage.
. A raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell negates
its 
	DR:and immunity to magic for 1 minute.
Bone golems are most often crafted as guardians of tombs-
and sometimes formed from the very corpses they guard.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Wisdom Drain (Su) A creature that takes rend
damage from a moon-beast must succeed at a DC
22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. A
moon-beast heals 5 points of damage for each point of
Wisdom it drains in this manner. If it drains a victim to
0 Wisdom, the moon-beast gains the effects of a heal spell.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Moon-beasts have no voice or eyes, yet they "see" more
than most and can project their thoughts into the very
minds of those they wish to communicate with. These
monstrosities hail not from any physical moon, but rather
from the shared satellite of all slumbering minds in the
Dimension of Dream beyond the wall of sleep. Here, the
moon-beasts raise stone cities on the oily shores of nightblack
seas found upon the dark side of the dreaming
moon, from which they launch long, dark galleys crewed
by not-quite-human slaves that sail through the void of
space down to the seas of the Dimension of Dream to seek
new slaves and stranger, more sinister wares.
Moon-beasts are slavers, first and foremost. They use
their spell-like abilities to curb rebellion or to quickly
gain minions, but much prefer using physical and mental
regimens of torment and reconditioning to break the
spirit of their captives. They often work with the denizens
of Leng, a metaphysically nearby dimension of nightmare
and madness, although as often as not these planar
neighbors serve the moon-beasts merely as slaves.
Worshipers of ageless entities from beyond the stars,
moon-beasts are often compelled to travel to the Material
Plane for strange and frightening causes, not the least
of which is gathering suitable
sacrifices for their mysterious
and demanding lords.
A moon-beast is 9
feet long and weighs
800 pounds.

day to avoid becoming affected by a lesser geas (no HD
limit) that compels the sickly character to seek out the
nearest myceloid colony in order to offer itself up for spore
domination. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Spore Cloud (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a myceloid
can expel a 10-foot-radius burst of spores centered on itself.
This cloud persists for 1d3 rounds. Any creature caught
in this cloud or that moves through it is exposed to the
myceloid's purple pox disease-a creature need save only
once against any one spore cloud, however, before becoming
permanently immune to that particular spore cloud's effects.
The spore cloud does not hamper vision.
Spore Domination (Sp) This spell-like ability functions
as charm monster, but functions only against creatures
currently infected with purple pox.
The walking fungi known as myceloids feed off of
decaying organic matter like many other fungi, yet
unlike typical mushrooms or molds, they take particular
pleasure in feeding from the rotting bodies of humanoids.
Myceloids claim to be able to taste things like
"innocence," "despair," and "hope" in
the ripeness of rancid meat, although
whether this is true or simply part
of the myceloids' twisted sense of
humor is unclear.
Most myceloids have deep
purple caps studded with white
lumps, and paler purple necks and bodies
of tough, leathery fungus. Their spores
grow tenaciously in living flesh,
causing a rapid spread of painful
purple lesions that, in advanced
stages of the sickness, sprout tiny
purple mushrooms
plucking
these mushrooms is painful to
the victim and causes bleeding.
This condition, known as purple
pox, is the method by which
myceloids both season their
meat and procreate.
Myceloids prefer to
capture victims alive
for later infection and
control. To a myceloid,
a living creature has three
uses-first as a slave, second
as a host from which to birth
new myceloids, and finally as
a banquet to feast upon once the
first two destinies have played out.

Spells A lunar naga casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.
Lunar nagas are patient watchers of the night sky. They
enjoy cosmology and believe strongly in astrology,
maintaining a handful of complex zodiacs. A few lunar
nagas even bear knowledge of the unspeakable things
from the dark spaces between the stars. A lunar naga
stretches over 10 feet from its pale face to the tip of its tail,
and weighs close to 200 pounds.
Nocturnal creatures, lunar nagas often live in ruined
towers or atop mountains-
any place open to the sky
at night. There they peer through astrological devices,
closely monitoring passing celestial markers, eager to
decipher more of the universe. Those living underground
make nightly trips to the open sky when they can. Cloudy
nights make lunar nagas agitated, and a creature is more
likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark evenings.
Lunar nagas sometimes lead small cults of sky-watchers.
These followers aid the nagas in recording tome upon tome
of calculations of the stars and planets moving through
the inky black of the night sky. In small doses tempered
with water, fruit juices, and alcohol, lunar naga venom is
mildly hallucinogenic. The nagas' cultist allies often take
the substance as a ritualistic drug.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A royal naga can use this ability
to take one of five specific humanoid forms. Each
of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a
female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male
human, and so on) and the naga can
only use this ability to assume these
five forms. The naga can still use its
dual gaze in humanoid form.
Dual Gaze (Su) A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of
crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two
gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move
action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become
permanently blinded, while the other causes those that
succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude
save negates the effects of either gaze
otherwise, the effects
are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to
keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness
gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already
been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be
harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.
Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and
forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their
own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga's five faces are sharp
and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it
becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and
vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces
with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other
precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and
often weigh more than 750 pounds.
Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding
in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful
of strangers and seem to have great
difficulty speaking to other
creatures as equals.

Spells A water naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.
With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas'
serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although
doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in
common with normal snakes than most of their
kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and
lashing out at any creatures that would disturb
them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long
and weighs 250 pounds.
Where many nagas claim particular lairs
as their homes, water nagas typically have a
number of retreats, migrating from one to the
next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas
keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several
favored shelters positioned between these so they can
make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout
the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs,
water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their
sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once
such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.
As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially
well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs-
usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court
the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich
local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and
pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying
f lattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see
as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their
roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they
quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes
and often embellish the stories they've heard with their
own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such
misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The
congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the
entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with
only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures'
deadly Bite.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Crushing Blow (Ex)
When a nephilim makes
a successful critical hit with a melee
attack, the target must make a DC 22
Fortitude save or take an additional
3d6 points of nonlethal damage and
be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.
Mortal Challenge (Su) When a nephilim spends a standard
action to roar a battle challenge, all humanoids and

	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid
	s within 100 feet of the nephilim
must make a DC 18 Will save to avoid becoming frightened
for 5d6 rounds. On a successful save, the creatures only
become shaken for that time. Creatures with more HD
than the nephilim become shaken if they fail their save, and
suffer no effect if they succeed. A creature that succeeds at
the save is immune to that nephilim's mortal challenge for
24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC
is Charisma-based.
Soul of Sorrow (Ex) A nephilim gains a +2 bonus on Will saves
against fear effects and any effect that causes sorrow.
The nephilim are the offspring of demigods who bred
with humans. This joining resulted in a race of giant-sized
beings possessed of a shard of divine power and the
mortal consciousness of humans. A nephilim stands 11
feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds. Its divine heritage
grants it a lifespan of almost 600 years.
Nephilim are a nomadic, secretive race. This
isolationism has only heightened
the wild tales surrounding them,
making it even harder for other
races to trust them. While the
ancient animosity humans once
had against them has been largely
forgotten, zealots occasionally
try to mount pogroms
and crusades to wipe the
nephilim out forever. The
nephilim have proven
strikingly resistant to
these efforts.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Wild Empathy (Ex) This ability works like the druid ability of
the same name. The nixie's total includes a +8 racial bonus
on wild empathy checks.
Nixies are guardians of ponds, rivers, lakes, and
springs. They prefer dwelling in idyllic places,
which they protect from the depredations of
predators and careless humanoids. While this
often involves confusing enemies and driving
foes away, nixies are not afraid of spilling
blood to protect their homes-though they
prefer not to resort to such means unless
completely necessary. Nixies are 4 feet tall
and rarely weigh more than 45 pounds.
Nixies avoid combat if possible, using
charm person to lead humanoids away from
their lairs. They sometimes use this ability
to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task
that is simply too big for them to deal with. They cast water
breathing on charmed creatures helping with tasks below
the surface. Nixies are reclusive and prefer to keep their
presence hidden. They make lairs underwater, forming
small communities if their numbers are great enough.
Legends speak of a secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a
great lake, but no one has yet confirmed its location.
BOG NIXIES
In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to
drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets
with song or by assuming the form of an animal or
humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous
waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering
swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog
nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes,
ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as
brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out.
A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced
creature template who has the following additional
powers. A bog nixie's
	CR:is +2 higher than a normal nixie's.
Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability
of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows
the bog nixie to assume the form of any
	SIZE:S
	or Medium
aquatic animal or humanoid.
Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog
nixie can create a magical effect in
exchange for a gift or service from
a humanoid. The power of this
"wish" is no greater than what can
be done with a 3rd-level spell.

and on initiative checks.
Shears (Su) A norn's shears function as a +5 mithral keen speed
scimitar, but only for a norn.
Shift Fate (Su) As an immediate action, a norn can force any one
target within 120 feet to reroll a saving throw-this ability
must be used immediately after the saving throw is rolled,
and the target must abide by the result of this second roll.
Snip Thread (Su) As a standard action up to three times per day
but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a norn may
produce a golden thread linked to a creature's fate and then
attempt to snip it short with her shears. The target creature
must be within 120 feet and in the norn's line of sight. The
target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC
30 for half). If the target dies from this damage, the norn has
cut through the thread-in this case, the target may only be
restored to life via miracle, wish, or divine intervention. This is a
death effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.
Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful
women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation
of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch
over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon
or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted
and abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some,
the norns do little to discourage this veneration.
A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A nuckelavee's breath weapon is a
cone of withering foulness that causes painful welts,
cramps, and bleeding, and only harms living creatures-
this damage bypasses all energy resistance and damage
reduction. Non-creature plants in the area are affected as if by
a blight spell. Any creature that fails its Reflex save against the
breath weapon must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or contract
mortasheen (see below). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Disease (Su) Mortasheen: Contact
save Fort DC 21
frequency
1/day
effect 1d4 Con and target is fatigued
cure 2 consecutive
saves. Animals take a -2 penalty on their saves against this
disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.
The dreaded nuckelavee is a manifestation of pollution and
filth, be it the natural decay of a red tide or the intrusive
pollution of sewage and other urban waste. A nuckelavee
is a living irony-a carrier of disease and a spreader of
corruption that unleashes its wrath against other sources
that bring corruption into the world. The corruption
spread by nuckelavees only serves to further their own
sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While nuckelavees
might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims
of such pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers,
swamps, and bogs is not their primary drive, for they revel
in inf licting the very corruption they hate and enjoy little
more than watching their enemies sicken and die.
Folktales tell of talismans to carry-fetishes of seaweed
garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of
sanctified seawater-or of prayers to recite to ward
away nuckelavees or convince them
the bearer is innocent. In truth,
however, these old solutions
offer no protection from the
vile plague-bearers.
A nuckelavee is the same
size as a horse.

Cloud Form (Su) A
nue can change
into the form
of a 10-foot black
cloud or back to its
normal form as a standard
action. A nue in cloud

treated as if under the

This strange creature has the body of a tiger, the head of a
fanged monkey, and a poisonous viper for a tail. Though
some call it a chimera and treat it as an exotic specimen
of that creature, it is a completely different breed of beast.
Intelligent enough to enjoy cruelty as well as inf licting
terror upon its prey, a nue delights in toying with its
victim before dealing the killing blow. Often, a nue will
select a target and plague it with nightmares before it
even attempts an act of violence, wearing down the victim
with dreadful dreams and phantasmagoric terrors. Once
its prey is thoroughly exhausted, the nue will finally
steal into the victim's sleeping chambers and engage in
combat, paralyzing its target with its magic and infecting
its prey with both disease and poison, letting the victim
writhe in pain before succumbing to death.
A nue's ghastly appearance in physical form is only
made eerier by its ability to turn into an inky cloud of
darkness. In this guise, a nue can hide amongst fog clouds
or shadows before emerging as the destructive horror it is.
By the time a nue crawls forth from the inscrutable black
cloud, its prey is often too fatigued from its strange night
terrors to defend itself. The dreams a nue impregnates
creatures' minds with varies from victim to victim, but
all share the trait of an ever-present, foreboding cloud
that exudes a fierce and palpable sense of malice.
Some legends suggest that nues are the spirits of children
warped into twisted forms to spread paranoia, exhaustion,
and fear among former friends and family. According to
these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror upon its
friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven
mad by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more
challenging kills to sate its vicious hunger. The greatest joy
a nue can feel is snuffing the life of a oncestrong
and proud target that has been
brought low by its debilitating attacks.
A nue is 9 feet long and
weighs 600 pounds.

Oni
Oni are a race of evil spirits, native to the Material Plane,
that manifest physical bodies based upon the shapes and
desires of humanoid mortals. In pure spirit form, an oni
is nothing but a disembodied evil longing for the sins of
the f lesh. In this form, oni are harmless and invisible. The
majority of these bodiless oni were once kami who failed
their wards, or more often, who deliberately abandoned
them. As punishment, they were stripped of their ability
to form a physical body and then cast into the void. Rarely,
a mortal creature's soul can become a disembodied
oni upon death, or in even rarer cases, after a truly evil
individual has undergone a particularly vile ritual that
ends in suicide. These oni are more often destined for
positions of great power and strength than most.
Eventually, an oni's spirit manifests a physical body
on the Material Plane. The methods by which this may
occur vary, but the process generally takes place in areas
already despoiled by sin, tragedy, or cruelty. The type
of oni a spirit transforms into is inf luenced by a wide
variety of variables, ranging from the nature of what the
oni spirit was before to the location where it is reborn
into the realm of f lesh and blood. Once an oni manifests
its physical body, that body becomes its true form for
the rest of its life-all oni are shapechangers, but this
original form is the form in which they are born and the
form they revert to upon death.
An oni's true form is always similar to that of a specific
type of humanoid, save that it is always deformed and
monstrous to look upon. Tusks, additional eyes, or
strangely colored skin are common physical attributes.
Yet while they have hideous forms, all oni are capable of
changing their shape to assume forms more pleasant to
the civilized eye. The type of shapes an oni can assume
depend upon its species, but all can transform into some
form of humanoid. Oni use this ability to infiltrate
humanoid societies, either to prey upon the weak or to
rule them in disguise.
In order to understand oni, it is important to consider
that most of these beings were once spirits tasked
with protecting a material realm they now believe is
undeserving of such care and concern-indeed, the
physical world is to be dominated and consumed. They
arrive in physical form starved for sensory experience, and
never fully sate their desire to gorge on such experiences.
Most oni seek to attain positions of leadership and power,
often in the guise of a normal humanoid, in order to
secure a never-ending supply of sensory experiences. It is
also important to understand that oni's immoderation is
also motivated by their corrupted and evil natures-that
is, no pleasure is more enjoyable than one that deprives
or wounds another.
Oni retain their hatred of the kami upon reentering
the Material Plane as physical creatures, and often their
depredations and violations of the world can be directly
tied to their efforts to destroy kami or the kami's works.
Oni tend not to congregate with others of their kind,
being most comfortable in positions of leadership over
enslaved or oppressed societies populated by humanoids
they can masquerade as. Yet, at times, particularly
powerful oni abandon this mindset and instead gather to
their side entire legions of oni drawn from all types. The
oni known collectively as the yai-oni with an affinity for
true giants-are most often responsible for such actions,
and when a yai builds such an army of oni, the humanoid
lands shake with terror.
Theoretically, as many types of oni exist as there
are types of humanoids, although in reality, certain
types of oni are much more populous than others. The
ogre mage, an oni associated with ogres, is the bestknown
and most commonly encountered type of oni,
for reasons that still send scholars of oni lore into
spiraling arguments with seemingly no end. Beyond
the oni detailed on the following pages, the atamahuta
(ettins), ja noi (hobgoblins), nogitsune (kitsune), and
wind yai (cloud giants) are relatively well known. Oni
with associations to bugbears, great cyclopes, stone
giants, trolls, troglodytes, and other races exist as well.
And above even the mighty void yai there exist the oni
demigods-entities of nearly incomprehensible power
known as the oni daimyo.
Known Oni Daimyo
Countless oni stalk the world, slaking their greed and
bloodlust to the misery of humanoids. The great leaders
among the oni, beings known as daimyo, are as numerous as
the nations of the world, and all oni seek to climb the rungs
of power to become such powerful entities. The following list
includes oni daimyo that have power in ways that make them
known and feared outside their own domains. Most of these
nefarious oni command armies or control points through
which other oni can enter the world.
Akuma, the Horned King (ogre mage)
Chimon, Hunter of Blood (ogre mage)
Guyuku, the Sea Devil (water oni)
Inma, Empress of the World (void oni)
Muronna, the Dark Mother (ogre mage)
Nataka, the Red King (fire oni)

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Fiery Missile (Su) As a swift action, a fire yai can launch a bolt

Smoke Form (Sp) As a standard action, a fire yai can turn into
a cloud of smoke. This functions like gaseous form, except
the cloud has the properties of the smoke cloud from a
pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the effects of the smoke
cloud). The fire yai can end this ability as a standard action.
* See Ultimate Combat.
Fire yai prefer to live in luxury-an orderly and well-built
abode is essential. Even a lone fire yai prefers to build
or inhabit a fortified stone dwelling in its territory, and
surrounds itself with as many luxuries as it can acquire.
Vain, greedy, and brutal, fire yai are the most impulsive of
their kind-several tales tell of clever heroes taunting
fire yai to act rashly. They rarely let challenges pass
uncontested and react quickly to squelch any threat
to their rule.
While many fire yai seek out tribes of fire giants to
infiltrate and rule, not all follow this compulsion. Capable
of assuming the form of many types of humanoid, some
fire yai seek to subtly invade and eventually rule entire
nations of humanoids from within.
A fire yai is 16 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Icy Missile (Su) As a swift action, the ice yai can
fire a dart of ice from its third eye. This dart is a
ranged touch attack (+20 attack bonus), dealing 4d6
points of cold damage on a hit. This attack has a range
of 180 feet with no range increment.
Staggering Strikes (Ex) An ice yai can strike twice per round
with its two Slam attacks. A creature struck by
more than two of these Slam attacks in a round must make
a DC 28 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The
save DC is Strength-based.
The ice yai is a sinister creature that combines the brutality
of a frost giant with the grace and style of a skilled martial
artist. Although its magical powers are formidable, it
prefers to fight in melee using its Slam attacks, leading its
minions in merciless combat. It uses its mobility to cast
combat spells or launch shards of ice from its third eye.
An ice yai is a natural leader among frost giants, tempering
their savagery with its own wisdom. A tribe led by an ice
yai may still raid settlements of neighboring humanoids,
but the tribe soon learns the value of establishing regular
tributes and willing sacrifices-the ice yai teach that
methods that rely upon the threat of violence are often even
more effective than actual violence. Despite this strangely
enlightened philosophy, an ice yai never passes up an
opportunity to reinforce its capacity for slaughter, and will
often demand that its subjects take part in show battles, both
for the entertainment of the tribe and to nurture the ice yai's
insatiable ego and sense of dominion over its subjects.

While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and
thus often end up having associations with giants and
other enormous humanoids, not all of them are born into
physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for
cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni
who clothe themselves in human f lesh. While their true
forms remain unmistakably fiendish, with golden skin,
Claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp horns,
kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans.
As with most oni, they generally avoid their own kind,
and instead seek positions of power in human cities, often
as guard captains, guildmasters (particularly of thieves'
guilds), and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the
role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an
appropriate class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious
kuwa avoid positions of true authority, such as king or
mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper echelon of
command, but avoid positions so important that they have
too many eyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership
that doesn't allow frequent abuse of that power is a waste,
and by aiming for less publicly visible positions, the kuwa
increases its opportunities for such abuse.
Once a kuwa secures a position in a human society, the
accumulation of wealth becomes its primary motivation. A
kuwa wants to live a life of decadence and sensual pleasure,
and like any oni, it wants to propagate its own kind. Its
strength and magical powers enable it to easily dominate
normal folk, allowing it to gather groups of thuggish, likeminded
humans to lead in banditry and worse.
A typical kuwa stands about 6 feet in height and weighs
190 pounds.

Mask Symbiosis (Ex) A spirit oni can be worn as a mask
by a willing
	SIZE:S
	or
	SIZE:M
	creature. While worn in
this way, the wearer can see through the oni's eyes and
speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its
own senses and voice. The spirit oni remains a separate
creature, and must detach from its host's face (as a move
action) if it wishes to take any action of its own (including
attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit oni is
worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host's
Perception checks.
Poison (Ex) Gore-injury

Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a
new body of humanoid f lesh, yet this is not the case for
all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to
engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result
is something relatively unusual-an oni made f lesh
directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes
the features of a humanoid as its own.
Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the
Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar.
The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster
to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking
oni mask-this does not require a Craft check or any
additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part
of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the
ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask,
which immediately transforms it into the animate, living
creature presented here.
While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it
also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a
human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered
and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They
must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest
their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them.
When a spirit oni's master dies, the spirit oni gains
free will and the ability to make its own choices-but
the spirit oni's innate cowardice and dishonor usually
prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning
to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni.
Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless
spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their
services to their superiors, in hopes that they might
someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state
to something more bef itting their egos and desires.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Commanding Voice (Su) A void oni gains a +4 racial bonus
on the save DC of any charm or compulsion effects it uses
against humanoids.
Void Form (Su) A void yai may become incorporeal as a swift
action. In this form, it appears as a solid black shadow of its
true form. It gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal
defensive ability while in void form. Any gear or armor the
yai carries becomes incorporeal as well-it loses its AC
bonus from armor and natural armor, but gains a deflection
bonus to its 		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|
equal to its Charisma modifier (+7 for most
void yai, for an 		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|
of 16). It may still speak while incorporeal
and can still use its spell-like and special abilities.
Void Missile (Su) As a swift action, a void yai can launch a
bolt of darkness from its third eye. Damage caused by this
missile is negative energy damage. This attack has a range
of 180 feet with no range increment.
Void Trap (Su) When a void oni uses any teleportation effect
on itself (including its greater teleport and plane shift spelllike
abilities, but not its teleport object spell-like ability), it
can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free
action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser
sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part
of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation
cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere
itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the
closest
	SIZE:T
	or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no
appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not
move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by
a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature
is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once
the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere
vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the
unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The
save DC is Charisma-based.
The concept of the void is a difficult one for many individuals
to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence
of anything. The concept of "void" as an element also
represents the heavens above, the dark places between
the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the
capacity to create and envision new ideas. The void yai
represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way
that exemplifies the evil of the oni race.
Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent any
single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps
the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially
resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily
muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests
when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt
and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely
the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation
spontaneously elevates an exiSting yai to the vaunted
210
Illustration by Jim Nelson
status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can
perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages
awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni
could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought
indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty.
As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and
armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall
and weighs 10,000 pounds.
Void yai turn toward the Material Plane to satisfy their
desires, lording over lesser creatures with the aid of the
void. A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing
much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai,
a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions,
but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe
or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands
kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense
void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small
and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out
of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of
their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are
masters of using their change shape ability to appear as
breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in
this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does
their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true,
horrific shapes.
VOIDLORDS
Between the considerable power of the typical void yai and
the divine might of the oni daimyos exists a middling
category of unique void yai. But to even use the term
"middling" in this context is something of a folly,
for these unique void yai, known collectively as the
voidlords, are among the most powerful creatures
to walk the Material Plane.
While void yai typically content themselves
with ruling nations, voidlords arrive with a
greater mission-to control entire worlds
and bring all that dwell upon these worlds to
their knees. Voidlords are always void yai with
additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels
of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite
choices for voidlords. These powerful
outsiders generally eschew spellcaSting
classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn
supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than
mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai
abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number
of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of
focus. Two sample voidlord foci are listed below, but these
represent only a tiny fraction of the total possible.
Martial Arts: A voidlord of martial arts always attacks
with unarmed strikes-it is treated as a 20th-level monk
with the f lurry of blows ability for the purposes of
determining its damage and number of attacks per round
with its unarmed strikes. This voidlord gains Stunning
Fist as a bonus feat, and gains the use of the following
spell-like abilities three times per day: forceful hand,
grasping hand, and greater shout.
Swordplay: A voidlord of sword fighting always carries
a sword of some sort-typically a katana. These voidlords
gain the ability to use the following spell-like abilities
three times per day: blade barrier, keen edge, and mage's sword.
They are automatically proficient in the use of swords, and
any sword they wield is treated
as a +5 weapon, in addition to
any other magical qualities
the weapon might have.
A voidlord of swordplay
can also permanently
transform any magic
weapon (save for
artifacts) into a
sword of any
size or type
by touch.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acidic Missile (Su) As a swift action, a water yai can
launch a bolt of acid from its third eye. Any creature
struck by this bolt must also make a DC 29 Fortitude
save to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round by the
overwhelming stench of the acid. This attack has a
range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
Flowing Robes (Su) A water yai wears a special silk kimono
infused with magical water. This kimono grants a +6 armor
bonus. These robes function as armor only for water yai.
Liquid Form (Sp) As a standard action, a water yai can turn into a
mobile pool of water. This functions like gaseous form, except
that the yai cannot fly in this form. It retains its own base
speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The water yai
can end this ability as a standard action.
The water yai clad themselves in the f lesh of storm giants,
yet these yai are more at home dwelling beneath the
waves than they are above them. Unlike most oni, water
yai have no real longing to rule or infiltrate societies-
yet they still enjoy posing as humanoids. They often
assume the forms of enormous merfolk in the water, but
prefer to adopt the shapes of storm giants when on land.
The water yai then pursues its favorite decadence-the
acclimation of material wealth and
luxuries. Water yai tend to be easily
distracted by beautiful treasures, and
despite their evil natures are prone to
acts of unexpected frivolity.

Animal Telepathy (Su) A giant owl can telepathically communicate
with other animals as if under the effects of speak with animals.
Insightful Senses (Su) A giant owl's senses are particularly

Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus (+3 for most giant
owls) on its initiative checks.
Piercing Stare (Su) Up to three times per day as a swift action,
a giant owl can gain the effects of true seeing (as the spell)
for 1 round.
The noble giant owl roosts in the tallest trees or in high
caves near its forest home. No mere animals, giant owls pride
themselves as intellectuals and keen judges of character.
Little passes a giant owl's notice in its home forest. What
it doesn't observe directly, it learns from its wide network
of animal informants. Giant owls view themselves more as
watchers than participants, rarely interfering in the affairs
of others barring a threat to their homes. Giant owls stand
18 feet tall and have 30-foot wingspans, yet they rarely weigh
over 600 pounds.

Great horned owls primarily hunt at night, locating

of rodents supplemented by smaller birds and rabbits.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Pistols (Su) A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A pistol has
a range increment of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning
and piercing damage. At a range of up to 20 feet,
a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch
attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets
and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's
pistols supernaturally reload the instant it
fires them, allowing the undead to make
multiple attacks in a round with the weapons.
In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields
functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not
provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a
pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons
for the purposes of determining penalties from twoweapon
fighting. Further rules for pistols, and firearms in
general, can be found in Ultimate Combat.
Stranger's Luck (Su) A pale stranger gains a +3 luck bonus to
		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|
and has no chance of misfire when using firearms.
Stranger's Shot (Ex) As a full-round action, a pale stranger can
take careful aim with one of its firearms and take a single,
ruinous shot. This single shot always resolves as a touch
attack, regardless of the actual range. If the pale stranger
threatens a critical hit with this shot, it automatically
confirms the critical hit. Regardless of whether the shot is a
critical hit or not, it deals +6d6 points of damage.
Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger
and its final revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a
hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve vengeance
against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its
remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a pale
stranger first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to
finish the job-thereafter, it wanders the desolate parts
of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending
rage upon.
A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though
desiccated and obviously undead. Rare pale strangers
have the ability to hide their undead nature and appear
as they did in life using veil as a constant spell-like ability
(CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more
powerful and have class levels in gunslinger or ranger,
and often attract large groups of adoring bandits
and followers who may or may not realize that their
murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror.
A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs
130 pounds.

Infestation (Ex) Any living creature that takes damage
from a rot grub swarm becomes infested unless
it succeeds at a DC 19 Reflex save. On a failed
save, the infested creature takes 1d4 points of
Constitution damage per round as the rot grubs
burrow through and consume its flesh-this
effect continues as long as the victim remains
in the swarm and continues for 1d6 rounds after it
leaves the swarm. Any energybased
attack (including damage
from negative energy) that
deals at least 5 points of damage
to the victim automatically
destroys all of the rot
grubs infeSting it, ending
the effect prematurely.
Additionally, any effect that
removes disease
instantly ends a rot
grub infestation.
Immunity to disease

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Hexes A penanggalen witch can use one of her hexes at will
on any creature within 30 feet. Using a hex is a standard
action (unless otherwise noted) that does not provoke an
attack of opportunity. Save DCs are Intelligence-based.
Cackle Hex (Su) As a move action, the penanggalen may
cackle. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effects of
the penanggalen's evil eye or misfortune hex has the duration
of that hex extended by 1 round.
Evil Eye Hex (Su) This hex causes the target creature to take
a -2 penalty on one of the following (penanggalen's choice):
AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks.
This effect lasts for 6 rounds, or only 1 round if the target
succeeds at a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Misfortune Hex (Su) This hex causes a creature to suffer
grave misfortune for 1 round. Whenever the target makes an
ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check during
this time, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A DC 15
Will save negates this effect. A creature may only be targeted
by this hex once per day.
The hideous penanggalen is one of the most horrific
vampiric monstrosities. By day, a penanggalen appears
to be a normal humanoid, but at night or when provoked,
the creature's head rips free from the rest of her body,
coils of viscera and entrails dangling from her throat
as she launches into the air, seeking blood to sate her
unholy thirst.
Unlike most undead, the penanggalen is more akin to
the lich in that she willfully abandons both her mortality
and morality to become a hideous undead monster.
While penanggalens are traditionally female spellcasters,
any creature capable of performing the vile ritual of
transformation can become one.
Similar to a lich, a creature works toward becoming a
penanggalen. More than one such transformation ritual
exists, but all require heinous acts that symbolize the
caSting aside of kindness, benevolence, and any semblance
of feelings other than cruelty. Many of these rituals call for
the repeated consumption of blood, bile, tears, and other
f luids drawn from captured and tortured innocents.
A penanggalen keeps a vat of vinegar in her lair. When
returning from a night of feeding, a penanggalen's organs
are swollen with blood. In order to fit back into her body,
the penanggalen must soak for 1 hour in this vat of vinegar.
Once reduced, a penanggalen slides back into her body. If a
penanggalen is slain away from her body, the body rapidly
deteriorates into foul-smelling grit.
The penanggalen presented above was a witch in
life. The witch class is presented in full in the Advanced
Player's Guide.
CREATING A PENANGGALEN
"Penanggalen" is an acquired template that can be added
to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to
hereafter as the base creature). Most penanggalens were
once humanoids or 
	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid
	s and nearly
every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base
creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.
CR: Same as base creature +1.
216
Illustration by Kieran Yanner
Alignment: Any evil.
Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented).
Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
Senses: A penanggalen gains darkvision 60 ft.
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.
Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s.
All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As
undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to
determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel
resistance +4, 
	DR:5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold
10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by
the undead type. A penanggalen also gains 
	BONUS:VAR|FastHealingRate|5.
Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In
addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her
human body and exposed to direct sunlight.
Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she
retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a
penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a f ly
speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.
Melee
: A penanggalen gains a Bite attack and a Slam
attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is
standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen's
size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base
creature's special attacks. She also gains the following
additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2
the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma
modifier unless otherwise noted.
Blood Drain (Su): A penanggalen's blood drain special
attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage.
Create Spawn (Su): When a penanggalen slays a female
humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had
at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as
a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is
under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and
remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction.
A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling
no more than twice its own Hit Dice
any spawn it
creates that would exceed this limit become freewilled
undead.
Disease (Su): Any creature a penanggalen Bites
is exposed to filth fever-the save DC against this
disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease
itself.
Wither (Su): A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul
bile that blisters and weakens living f lesh. Any creature
that is damaged by a penanggalen's Slam attack must
succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4
Charisma damage.
Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an
undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score.
Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff,
Fly, Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and
Stealth checks.
Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following
special quality.
Separate (Su): During the day, a penanggalen has the
same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect
as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At
night, she can detach her head and entrails as a fullround
action. Her physical but now hollow body exists
as dead f lesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage
equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total. Before
a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her
entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to
her body, at which point any damage done to the body
immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen
herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is
destroyed can never again walk the day in living form,
but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a
safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen
wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her f ly
speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Flame Jump (Sp) A peri can enter any fire equal to the peri's
size or larger and travel any distance to another fire in a
single round, regardless of the distance between the two.
This ability otherwise functions as greater teleport (caster
level 14th), but the peri can transport only itself and up to
50 pounds of objects.
Smoke Sight (Su) A peri can see through fire, fog, and smoke
without penalty.
Whirlwind Dance (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a
peri can spin in an ever-faster, whirling dance, transforming
itself into a spinning vortex of flame 10 to 40 feet high
for up to 9 rounds. This ability functions as the whirlwind
ability (DC 26 Reflex save), but any creature that comes in
contact with the whirlwind or is caught inside it takes 2d6+6
points of fire damage and is subject to the peri's burn
special attack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Peris are a race of celestials native to the good-aligned
Outer Planes, but they are also often found in the
company of mortals on the Material Plane. Believed to
be the descendants of fallen angels, peris do penance
for their ancestors' sins before they can earn a place in
paradise. As a result, peris work tirelessly to aid and
support good heroes of the mortal realms in a neverending
battle against evil.
Peris hate the evil fiends known as divs, who constantly
seek to ruin the good works of mortals. Peris often work
to repair damage wrought by the destructive divs. For
their part, the divs take great pleasure in tormenting and
persecuting peris, locking the fiery-winged celestials in
cages of cold iron and endlessly torturing them.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Magnetic Pulse (Su)
A plasma ooze is
surrounded by an
aura of magnetism
that allows it to attract
metallic objects and
creatures. At the start
of the ooze's turn as
a free action, the ooze
makes a combat maneuver
check against all metallic
creatures, all creatures wearing
metal armor, and all creatures
wielding metal weapons within
30 feet. If it beats the CMD of a
metal or armored creature with this check, that creature is
pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze and cannot move away from
the ooze for 1 round. If this causes the creature to move into
a square occupied by the plasma ooze, the ooze can attempt
to engulf that creature as a free action. If it beats the CMD of
a creature wielding a metal weapon, that weapon is disarmed
and pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze. Unattended metal
objects of size
	SIZE:L
	or smaller are automatically pulled
toward a plasma ooze. This magnetism is supernatural in
nature and affects all metal objects.
Plasma Ray (Su) As a standard action, a plasma ooze can fire
1d4 plasma rays at up to 4 separate targets within 60 feet
(no more than one ray can attack a single creature). Each ray
deals 4d6 points of electricity damage and 4d6 points of fire
damage on a hit.
Massive and devastating, plasma oozes are mysterious,
extraterrestrial beings made of superheated electromagnetic
sludge. While their origin is not fully known, it is widely
accepted that plasma oozes are not from this world.
Some scholars believe they dwell in the sun, while others
maintain they hail from the Plane of Fire. That plasma
oozes have been encountered in both of these locations
does little to help solve the debate.
A plasma ooze f lies by somehow interacting
with gravity and magnetic waves,
drifting through the air in a manner
similar to the way a jellyfish swims
in water. This creature's only real
purpose is to consume, and it prefers
to do so by drawing prey into
its fiery, electrified core.
Scholars find it curious
that while a plasma ooze
can only attract and repel
metallic substances, the thing
can only digest organic matter,
and rather slowly at that.
Survivors of plasma
ooze attacks are rare,
but such victims
describe the pain of
being struck by one's
rays as like being
pulled apart piece by
piece. Wounds left by a
plasma ooze's touch
resemble hideously
melted burn scars.
A plasma ooze is
20 feet in diameter
and weighs 6,000
pounds.

Change Shape (Su) A popobala loses its frightful
presence, popobala fever, and stench abilities
when not in its true form.
Harvester of Sorrow (Su) A popobala heals as a
result of the suffering of others. It gains

	BONUS:VAR|FastHealingRate|10 if at least one creature
within 15 feet has one or more of the following conditions:
confused, cowering, dying, exhausted, fatigued, frightened,
nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.
Horrid Haunting (Su) A popobala may use ghost sound or
ventriloquism as a free action whenever it manipulates a
creature or object with animate objects, dominate person, or
telekinesis. The ghost sound or ventriloquism originates from
the controlled object or creature.
Popobala Fever (Su) A creature wounded by a popobala's
talons becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes unless it makes
a DC 25 Fortitude save. A creature already sickened by the
fever becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds. One already
nauseated by the fever is helpless for 1d6 rounds. This is a
disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
The popobala is a much-feared shapeshifter that haunts
and hunts warm coastal lands, roaming night and day to
terrorize and spread anarchy and unrest while slaking its
insatiable twin urges for violence and prurience. Shifting
freely between bat, human, and its natural form, the
popobala is most dreaded for its mesmeric charms, but it
is more than capable of engaging in savage bloodletting
against those who anger it. Popobalas are attracted to
chaos, anarchy, and unrest, as the intensity of emotions
and uncertainty inf lames its already fierce urges. War,
changes of government, and religious or ethnic strife
or persecution-all of these excite a popobala, and if a
society remains too settled and stable, the beast is never
above fomenting unrest through its own predations.
A typical popobala is 5 feet tall with a 12 foot wingspan.
It weighs only 100 pounds.

Porcupines are omnivorous mammals that often climb
trees in search of food. The spines on

typically other small mammals.
Though primarily nocturnal,
porcupines do occasionally

More so than its smaller kin, the
human-sized giant porcupine is a
foul-tempered creature that is just as
content chewing on carrion as
on living creatures. Worse,
giant porcupines are
notorious in their almost
foolhardy bravery, and have
been known to attack
creatures much larger

This unexpected

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spawn Undead (Su) Any creature slain by a pukwudgie's
poisonous quills rises in 24 hours as a zombie. Undead
created by this ability are not immediately under the control
of a pukwudgie, but they receive a -4 penalty on saves
against a pukwudgie's control undead spell-like ability.
Poison (Su) Quill-injury
save Fort DC 18
frequency 1/round
for 6 rounds
effect 1d3 Con damage
cure 2 consecutive saves.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Quills (Ex) A pukwudgie can fire two of its quills as a ranged
attack as a standard action. These quills have a range
increment of 40 feet. Any creature attacking a pukwudgie
with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons,
or an unarmed strike takes 1d3 points of piercing damage.
A creature that grapples a pukwudgie takes 2d4 points of
piercing damage. Anyone who takes damage from these
quills is also exposed to the pukwudgie's poison.
The vile pukwudgie is a small, hunchbacked humanoid
covered with long, sharp quills. These quills, like those
of a porcupine, help protect the small creature but are
also dangerous offensive weapons, for the quills hold
a deadly poison that animates those it slays as zombies.
This necromantic nature, along with their penchant for
torment and sadistic ways, makes pukwudgies evil to the
core. A pukwudgie stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs a
little more than 30 pounds.
Pukwudgies are frequently found in the company
of undead. This retinue usually
consists of zombies and skeletons
created via their poisonous quills
ability or their ability to animate
dead bodies. They have a strong
preference for animating the
bodies of dead animals over
other creatures, and often use
undead animals as mounts.
A pukwudgie usually stays away
from well-traveled areas and
humanoid settlements, but
may sometimes slip into
small villages in the night
to steal children. The little
horrors enjoy the tender
f lesh of newborn babies
immensely, and are often
willing to go through great
personal risk to secure
infantile repasts when they
are available. Their delight
in arson only further
makes them a bane of
small villages.

Rakshasa
Rakshasas are born on the Material Plane, but they are
not of it. They possess the powers and shapes of fiends,
but their fates are inexorably tied to the mortal world, and
it is there that they seek to rule. The reincarnations of
manipulators, traitors, and tyrants obsessed with earthly
pleasures, rakshasas are the embodiments of the very
nature of materialistic evil. After dying violent deaths,
these spirits are so tied to worldly decadence and selfish
concerns that they take shapes that better ref lect the
baseness of their lives and are reborn as fiends. Thus have
sages come to know these beings as the "earthbound evils."
While there are many different types of rakshasas, from
the lowly raktavarna to the powerful maharaja, the most
commonly encountered members of this race (the rakshasas
presented in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) are not known
by any other name-they are more powerful than some
members of their kind and less powerful than others, and
represent the ideal midpoint between servitor and master.
These rakshasas can be recognized by their animal heads
(those of great cats, snakes, crocodiles, apes, and birds of
prey being the most common) and backward-facing hands.
Feral traits and strangely reversed joints are a hallmark of
all types of rakshasas, in fact, features that most rakshasas
can hide through their supernatural ability to change
shapes or by means of powerful illusions.
A rakshasa cannot impregnate another of its own kind,
and so new rakshasas come into being via the coupling
of a rakshasa and a non-rakshasa or, rarely, that of two
non-rakshasas. A rakshasa born to non-rakshasa parents
generally only occurs when one or both of the parents
commits a great evil during the mother's pregnancy,
allowing the disembodied spirit of a previously slain
rakshasa to reincarnate into the world by usurping the
unborn offspring's body. Rarely, such blasphemous births
aff lict good or innocent parents, typically in cases where
the parents are exposed to great evils beyond their control.
A rakshasa grows to maturity more quickly than a human,
and often functions as a full-grown adult earlier than age
14. Despite this quick maturation, a rakshasa can live for
500 years or more before dying, at which point its spirit
seeks a new host to be reborn in, continuing the vile cycle
of fiendish reincarnation over and over again.
Rakshasas believe that each and every creature in
the universe has a proper role to play, and that success
comes from understanding one's position and working
to improve it. Rakshasas don't see castes as good or evil,
but rather as purely pragmatic. Creatures of higher caste
should be respected for their great power, and those of
lower caste should be pressed into willing service to
expand the holdings of those of higher castes as their
betters seek greater wealth and inf luence.
There are seven castes in rakshasa society (from
lowest to greatest): pagala (traitors), goshta (food), adhura
(novices), darshaka (servants), paradeshi (rakshasa-kin),
hakima (lords), and samrata (lords of lords). The rakshasa
caste system encompasses not just all of rakshasa society,
but all of life-although only rakshasas can attain the
stations of darshaka and above.
While rakshasas are forced to admit that the gods have
powers greater than their own, most rakshasas scoff at
the concept of divinity as a whole. The gods are among
the most powerful beings in existence, to be sure, but too
many examples of powerful, ambitious, or merely lucky
mortals attaining divinity exist for rakshasas to pay
religious homage to such creatures. Rakshasas see their
own transitions from mortals to otherworldly beings as
marks of their own fathomless potential and their initial
steps on the path to godhood. Thus, as a race, rakshasas
deny the worship of deities, although they welcome
alliances with the servants of such peerlessly potent
beings when it serves their purposes.
The skin of a rakshasa is remarkably resistant to
physical damage, able to ignore or greatly reduce most
weapon attacks. Holy weapons capable of piercing this
skin, however, can reach a rakshasa's vitals and do
significant damage. As a result, in lands where their kind
are well known, rakshasas take great pains to disguise
themselves with magic when they are among enemies.
Rakshasa Immortals
The rakshasa immortals are rakshasas who have ascended
beyond mortality-they are no longer bound to the cycle of
reincarnation and rebirth most rakshasas endure, and are truly
immortal. Such creatures, given the span of countless lifetimes
to perfect their art and master their cruelties, approach the
power of gods. The following list includes several (but by no
means all) rakshasa immortals known to the world. Among
them, Ravana is the greatest and most ancient.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spells A dandasuka casts arcane spells as a 2nd-level sorcerer.
Dandasukas, also known as "Biters" among rakshasas,
serve as spies and assassins. They often appear as part of
a rakshasa's retinue or secret network. Born to manipulate
and murder, they revel in their work and delight in the sight
of blood. Thus, dandasukas go about their work cheerfully,
laughing as they manipulate foes and butcher victims.
All dandasukas are restless and energetic. They crave
activity and entertainment, preferring the sick and
cruel to conventional fare. Dandasuka pranks are rarely
amusing for the victim.
Monstrous hunger gnaws at the hyperactive dandasuka's
body, making the creature crave humanoid f lesh and
blood. When such blood is spilled, a dandasuka is often
not able to contain its fiendish appetite. It might lick a
bloody blade, lap up fallen drops, or even take a Bite out of
a fallen foe at the expense of a more tactically sound option
in a fight. A dandasuka settles for other meat when it must,
but it always prefers humanoid f lesh.
Murder and mayhem are not the only duties of a
dandasuka. Stronger rakshasas dispatch dandasukas
as emissaries and servants to allies. Despite their usual
disorderly habits, they bargain good-naturedly and in good
faith, only implying dire consequences for noncompliance.
Dandasuka negotiators efficiently take care of impasses if
no favorable resolution can be reached. Similarly, dandasuka
retainers serving rakshasa allies curb their fiendish ways as
best they can, though their employers would still do well to
keep them amused and fed. One has to be careful of keeping
dandasukas too pleased, however, since they are known to
take unwanted initiative because of off-hand remarks, such
as idle wishes that a certain person were dead.
Dandasuka greed extends from amusements and food to
wealth. All dandasukas love comfort, fine clothing, and shiny
baubles. Most of them wear as much jewelry as they possibly
can without looking ridiculous, and some cross that line. A
dandasuka is 3 feet tall and weighs 55 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Extra Initiative (Su) When an encounter starts, a maharaja
rolls twice for initiative. The maharaja acts normally on
the higher of the two initiative counts each round. On
the lower initiative count, the maharaja can take a single
standard action.
Spells A maharaja casts arcane spells as an 18th-level sorcerer.
All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for
whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a
birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the
maharajas-those rakshasas whose depredations and
acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their
kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments
of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the
beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference
of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within
the rakshasa race that few can: fear.
A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa
of great power and inf luence has spent several lives as
a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's
social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends
to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with
rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young
maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth
of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The
maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a laSting
nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine
ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer
its domain, often splitting the region into large enough
chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still
have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more
than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century.
So great is a maharaja's power and inf luence and so
long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying
the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating
armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can
often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its
servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids,
or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned
outsiders-lounging in opulence.
The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent
mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree
decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with
226
Illustration by Eva Widermann
rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather
than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with
exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer
creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the
trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of
defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the
heads of failed lieutenants.
A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does
not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal
servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling
adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's
rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to
ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and
illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats.
Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control,
most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and
lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly.
RAKSHASA RAJADHIRAJAS
Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution
granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate
the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path
teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A
typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment,
and illusion. Other maharajas master various other
techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a
maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its
powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately
ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja-a king of kings.
Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas
are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower
than
	CR:21-most have additional racial Hit
Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each
additional racial Hit Die granted increases the
rakshasa's
	CR:by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer
caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that
follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A
rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time
might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per
day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees
itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use
shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of
combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like
abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa
gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells
should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells
usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level
at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as
you see fit to make a more intereSting rajadhiraja.
The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories
it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power
to manipulate life and death according to this cycle.
A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to
alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all
rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition
to their other powers.
Reincarnate (Su): Once per day as a standard action,
a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if
using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must
have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed
by a death effect. As with any effect that restores life to a
creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be
reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to
happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via
true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their
own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to
allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The
new form granted by this effect can be any form within
one size category of the dead creature's original size-the
exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja.
Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate
spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical
ability score adjustments.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Confusion (Su) A creature bitten by a marai's Bite (from
either its actual mouth or the snakes it has for hands) must
succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1
round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Energy Bolts (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action
that provokes an attack of opportunity, a marai's six snake
arms can each spit a bolt of energy to a maximum range
of 60 feet. Each bolt deals 1d8 points of damage and has
an additional effect if the target fails to resist it with a DC
19 Fortitude save, as summarized below. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Amethyst Viper: Cold damage plus sickened for 1d4 rounds.
Crimson Viper: Fire damage plus burn (1d4, DC 19).
Emerald Viper: Acid damage plus nauseated for 1 round.
Magenta Viper: Electricity damage plus staggered for 1 round.
Turquoise Viper: Sonic damage plus stunned for 1 round.
Violet Viper: Force damage plus knocked prone.
Spells A marai casts arcane spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.
Marai are deviant spellcasters first and fiendish corruptors
second. If allowed to indulge in their desire for perverse
mystical study, most marai are content to serve as part
of another rakshasa's cabal. A solitary marai might pose
as a neophyte magician to infiltrate another spellcaster's
abode. If the marai is successful, the master soon becomes
either the servant or a corpse.
The possibility of new magical discoveries drives a
marai. Morality and compassion never constrain the
fiend's experiments. A marai prefers to torment and
exploit mortals who have no idea of the rakshasa's true
nature, and it takes great pleasure in using magical might
to bring would-be heroes,
especially those who
invade its lair, to their
knees. Such a game
offers a marai enjoyment,
however, only if subjects are unaware of the
danger or at least unable to oppose it.
A marai is 6 feet tall and weighs 160
pounds. Its serpentine arms render fine
manipulation or wielding weapons unfeasible,
and so it typically assumes humanoid form when
working on experiments that require manual dexterity. A
marai unable to do so must rely upon cantrips like
mage hand for such tasks-or perhaps
the aid of a slave or charmed ally.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) As a full-round action, a raktavarna can
take the shape of a handheld object, most often an
ornamental light, a one-handed weapon, or a piece
of treasure. If the rakshasa remains stationary
in such a form, it can attempt Stealth checks
even while being observed. It can remain
motionless in object form indefinitely, but
reverts to its true form as soon as it takes
any action.
Master's Eyes (Su) A raktavarna can
designate a single creature as its master
as a standard action. If the raktavarna
is a spellcaster's familiar, its master is
automatically that spellcaster, and the
raktavarna cannot change this. As a fullround
action, a raktavarna's master can observe
the world as if looking through the raktavarna's eyes. The
master must concentrate to maintain this link each round.
The master's visual senses are suppressed for this time, and
he uses the raktavarna's darkvision, detect magic, and regular
eyesight to observe the world. This ability has no limit on
range, and functions even across planar boundaries. If the
raktavarna is slain while its master is using this ability, the
master is stunned for 1d4 rounds (no save).
Poison (Su) Bite-injury
save Fort DC 13
frequency 1/round
for 6 rounds
effect 1d2 Wis plus modify memory
cure 1 save.
Each time a victim takes Wisdom damage from this poison, a
modify memory effect causes the victim to forget the previous
minute's interactions with the raktavarna, as long as the
raktavarna is no longer visible or is in object form. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the
least of the rakshasas-they are born not from humanoids,
but from the souls of rakshasas who failed utterly in their
previous incarnation and who are thus reborn from a
serpent's egg.
These terrors drift through society, passing from hand
to hand as weapons or strange tokens from foreign lands,
curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and
given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas
gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world,
and what they see, their foul masters know. A raktavarna's
servitude to a master ends only when its master decrees,
or (more commonly) upon the master's death. Little
disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master,
and when they are cast adrift in this manner, they seek a
replacement as soon as they can.
A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with
the Improved Familiar feat can gain a
raktavarna rakshasa as a familiar.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Martial Artist (Su) A tataka's unarmed strikes deal 2d6 points
of damage. If a tataka gains monk levels, it uses its tataka
unarmed strike damage or its monk unarmed strike damage,
whichever is higher. Its unarmed strikes function as lawful
and evil weapons for overcoming damage reduction.
Spells A tataka casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. A tataka
can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally
available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane
spells for a tataka.
Tataka rakshasas are the least subtle and largest of their
kind. They are philosophers and fanatics, loyal servants of
the rakshasa immortals. Their familiarity with religion
and its trappings makes them excellent corruptors and
blasphemers. Such rakshasas might assault sacred sites
or rituals directly so as to foil good works and slay holy
people. A tataka holds all religions in contempt save the
worship of rakshasas, and it openly mocks and assaults
any who dare believe otherwise.
Tataka rakshasas are more than zealots, though, and
they train from an early age in martial arts-their strikes
can break bones as surely as any unarmed strike from
a monk or other practitioner of such
styles of combat.
A typical tataka is 12 feet tall and
weighs 1,300 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Swarming (Ex) Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally,
and are adept at swarming foes for their own gain and their
foes' detriment. Up to two ratfolk can share the same square at
the same time. If two ratfolk in the same square attack
the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Ratfolk are small, rodentlike humanoids
often found traveling in nomadic trading
caravans or perhaps dwelling in colonies
in slums, sewers, and other normally
undesirable urban sectors. Tinkerers
and hoarders by nature, many ratfolk
are shrewd merchants, carefully
navigating the shifting alliances
of black markets and bazaars.
They love their stockpiles of
intereSting items far more
than money, and would rather trade for more baubles to
add to their hoards than for mere coins.
Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in large
warrens with plenty of hidden crannies in which to stash
their hoards or f lee in times of danger, gravitating toward
subterranean tunnels or tightly packed tenements in
city ghettos. They feel an intense bond with their large
families and kin networks, as well as with ordinary
rodents of all sorts, living in chaotic harmony and
fighting fiercely to defend each other when threatened.
Ratfolk are generally 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. They
often wear robes to conceal their forms in cities, as they know
other humanoids find their rodent features distasteful.
RATFOLK CHARACTERS
Ratfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess
racial Hit Dice. All ratfolk have the following racial traits.
-2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence: Ratfolk are
agile and clever, yet physically weak.
Small: Ratfolk are
	SIZE:S
	and gain a +1 size bonus to their
AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on CMB
and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.
Darkvision: Ratfolk can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
Tinker: Ratfolk gain a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy),
Perception, and Use Magic Device checks.
Rodent Empathy: Ratfolk gain a +4 bonus on Handle
Animal checks made to inf luence rodents.
Swarming: See above.
Languages: Ratfolk begin play speaking Common.
Ratfolk with high intelligence can choose from any of
the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven,
Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Undercommon.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Beckoning Call (Su) As a standard action, a rusalka can sing
or speak, causing all non-fey creatures within a 300-foot
spread to approach its position as if compelled to do so
via a suggestion spell (DC 27 Will negates). A creature that
successfully saves is not subject to the same rusalka's
beckoning call for 24 hours. When an affected creature begins
its turn adjacent to the rusalka, it is dazed for that round.
These effects continue as long as the rusalka takes a standard
action to maintain the effect, plus 1 additional round. This is
a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Staggering Touch (Su) A creature touched by a rusalka must
make a DC 27 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by
overwhelming feelings of desire and shame. This is a mindaffecting
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Tresses (Su) A rusalka's long hair is strong and capable of
making powerful primary natural attacks. When it uses its
tresses to grapple an opponent, a rusalka does not gain
the grappled condition itself. In addition, a rusalka uses its
Charisma modifier in addition to its Strength modifier for all
combat maneuver checks made with its tresses.
Rusalkas are cruel and bitter fey who inhabit waterways near
humanoid settlements. Although rusalkas are not undead,
some persist in believing that these fey form from the
spirits of those who met a sinister end in the water. Rusalkas
do little to dissuade such rumors. Rusalkas are fond of
keeping a few charmed monsters or powerful humanoids
nearby to aid in their defense or for other forms of cruel
and humiliating entertainment, but quickly grow bored
with such pets. When this occurs, rusalkas generally
murder the creatures and seek more intereSting
replacement pets.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dust Cloud (Ex) A sabosan gains Hover
as a bonus feat, and can use this feat to
create a dust cloud even though it is not
Large. The resulting dust cloud has only a
30-foot radius.
Fell Shriek (Su) As a standard action, a
sabosan can emit a deafening cry in a
30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must
make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save
or be deafened for 1 minute. Sabosan are
immune to this ability. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Sabosan are an intelligent and evil race
of batlike humanoids that dwell in warm
and isolated forests or deep underground in
vast caverns.
Sabosan are vicious predators, combining human
intelligence with a bat's natural adaptations for hunting.
They favor warm climates, preferring to make their lairs
in places that are inaccessible to most intruders, such
as mountaintop crags, abandoned ruins, subterranean
caverns near hidden hot springs, and dense canopies of
jungle trees. With wingspans almost three times their
height, sabosan are agile and graceful f liers, capable
of traveling miles on a single current of air in their
dauntless search for prey.
Although they can see as well as any human in
daylight, sabosan hunt at twilight or after dark when
their echolocation-based blindsense ability gives them
a great advantage. Sabosan can also use their voices
offensively, funneling their screeches into blasts of highpitched
sound capable of deafening other creatures.
When hunting en masse or attacking foes, a sabosan
employs its fell shriek on adversaries while other sabosan
use their massive wings to churn up great clouds of dust
and debris, rendering foes deaf and blind.
A sabosan's emaciated frame belies its strength and
agility, which are not apparent from its gaunt appearance.
Its giant, leathery wings can reach a span of almost 20
feet. Both males and females have red or dark brown fur
on their heads, necks, chests, and backs. Sabosan
stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh only
150 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Baleful Whinny (Su) As a standard action, a sagari can emit
a monstrous whinny. Any creature within 60 feet must
succeed at a DC 12 Will save or become sickened for
1d4 rounds by the hideous sound. This is a sonic, mindaffecting
effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the
affected creature is immune to the same sagari's baleful
whinny for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Flight (Su) A sagari's flight is supernatural in nature.
Lashing Strike (Ex) Although a sagari is Tiny, it does not
provoke attacks of opportunity when it makes melee
attacks. In addition, its tentacle attack is a primary attack.
Sagaris haunt forest trails, hanging upside-down from
tree branches by the grotesque tentacles that make
up their necks. Unexpectedly intelligent, these cruel
RACETYPE:Aberrations swoop down from their perches to attack
unsuspecting travelers wandering through the forests.
Their piercing whinny causes sickness within those
who hear it, the sound waves reverberating within the
victims' chests and causing them to feel unwell. Groups
of sagaris are particularly dangerous, filling the air with
their terrifying neighs and diving upon utterly helpless,
nauseated victims in a rush.
The tentacle of a sagari is not strong enough to grab
or strangle enemies, but serves the creature well as an
additional attack to augment its Bite. Sagaris are strictly
carnivorous, and while they resort to feeding on carrion
if necessary, they greatly prefer fresh meat. When a sagari
makes its way into a settlement either to wreak havoc or
by accident, it can be found hanging from the rafters of a
barn or some other structure with a tall ceiling. Stabled
livestock are ideal prey for sagaris, who can swiftly kill
and devour the f lesh of a trapped animal in minutes. A
sagari will not attack a creature that it suspects is much
stronger, though it will sometimes assault groups of
creatures, hoping to sicken enough of its foes to distract
them while it attacks the weakest individual.
Sagaris are thought to have originally come from the
vast caverns beneath the world's surface. While sagaris
can speak, they rarely do so with those they deem prey,
seeing little point in communicating with food. Despite
their relative intelligence, sagaris rarely form societies of
any nature, at most traveling in roving packs in search of
larger prey to take down as a group.
A sagari is 3 feet long from mouth to tentacle and
weighs 30 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Grab (Ex) A sargassum fiend can grab
	SIZE:H
	or smaller
foes, and has a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks
rather than the normal +4 bonus most creatures with
grab possess.
Mirage (Su) A sargassum fiend emits a powerful
scent that causes specific, miragelike
hallucinations. All creatures within 300 feet of a
sargassum fiend must make a DC 18 Will save or
become enraptured by the scent. An enraptured
creature sees the monster as whatever would
most compel it to approach. This might be
a lost loved one, a child in need of help,
an enchanting mermaid, the promise of
dry land, and so on. The extent of this
illusion functions as mirage arcana (CL
equals the sargassum's CR), but is a mindaffecting
phantasm, not a glamer. This effect
ends immediately if the plant makes an attack against any
target. The save DC is Charisma-based.
A sargassum fiend is a free-f loating mass of intelligent
seaweed capable of luring its victims to their deaths via a
powerful hallucinogenic pheromone. Once the sargassum
fiend lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the
entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death.
Experienced sailors tell tales of entire crews jumping
overboard to swim out to a murderous field of the sea plants.
The strange pheromone produced by a sargassum fiend
can be harvested from the numerous bulbs that grow within
the fiend's body, but these bulbs rot quickly once harvested.
A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless
until
that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce
a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend
generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harveSting
one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical
or magical process has successfully preserved this musk.
Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet
in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual
reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist,
however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual
sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size,
up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be
created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD
per size increase step.

Pungency (Ex) A sasquatch's odor is quite powerful, and can be
detected at twice the normal distance by scent.
Woodland Stride (Ex) A sasquatch can move through any
sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at normal speed and
without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
Undergrowth that has been magically manipulated to
impede movement still affects the sasquatch.
The elusive sasquatches earn their
mysterious reputation rightly;
they live in unpopulated forests
and avoid confrontations with
humanoids, only becoming violent
when they feel threatened, when their
territory is encroached upon, or when they
feel they must protect their young. Left to
their own devices, sasquatch families are
perfectly content to live their lives in the deep
woods, leaving behind little to no trace of their passing save
for the periodic big footprint in the ground.
Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are
incredibly stealthy creatures, capable of moving through
forests in particular with astonishing grace and efficiency.
The one trait that somewhat undermines sasquatches'
stealth is their distinctive odor-a pungent, musky scent
that is often noticeable even when the hidden sasquatches
themselves are not apparent.
The elusiveness of sasquatches is such that even in a
world where dragons and sea monsters are real, many
urban scholars doubt the existence of the creatures, citing
the lack of evidence of sasquatch lairs or remains as proof
of their nonexistence. In truth, sasquatches are simply far
more efficient at living in harmony with nature than most
humanoids could ever hope to be. To a sasquatch, a deadfall
in a forest makes a perfectly fine home. When a sasquatch
dies, its kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide all
trace of the gravesite to protect the remains from scavengers
and evil spirits alike. The sasquatch tongue is a relatively
complex language that mixes vocalizations, howls, and
"knocking"-the act of striking a solid surface (like a tree
or boulder) with a club or stone-and thus tends to blend in
with the ambient sounds of a forest.
A sasquatch is 8 feet tall and weighs 570 pounds. Rural
populaces often have fond nicknames for these creatures,
such as wild men, skunk apes, and perhaps most popularly,
simply bigfoot.

Sudden Strike (Ex) A deadfall scorpion is adept at moving
quickly when its foes are surprised. During a surprise
round, a deadfall scorpion may act as if it had a full
round to act, rather than just one standard action.
The enormous deadfall scorpion is disturbingly
stealthy for a creature of its size. So named for
the creatures' habit of making their lairs
amid the hollows created by deadfalls of
old trees, deadfall scorpions adorn their
already camouf laged carapaces
with moss and old branches, then
lie in wait to ambush prey when it
draws near. They prefer to drag
their prey back to their hidden
deadfall lairs to eat, and
thus incidental treasure can
often be found within such
a den. A deadfall scorpion is
24 feet long and weighs
10,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Anchored (Ex) As a full-round action, a giant sea anemone can
affix itself to a solid surface. While anchored, it cannot move,
and it gains a +4 bonus to its CMD on all checks to resist being
bull-rushed, dragged, overrun, or repositioned. This bonus
increases by +4 for each size category larger the sea anemone
is compared to the opponent attempting the maneuver. The
creature can unanchor itself as a full-round action.
Poison (Ex) Tentacle-
injury
save Fort DC 16
frequency
1/round for 6 rounds
effect 1d2 Dex damage
cure
2 consecutive saves.
Sightless (Ex) A sea anemone is blind and
is not affected by any effect that relies on
sight, such as gaze attacks or blindness.
Giant sea anemones are beautiful but
deadly ocean-dwelling vermin that rely on
camouf lage and paralytic toxins to draw
in their prey. A sea anemone has a
long, cylindrical body that ends in
a f lat circular disc with a slitlike
orifice for both ingeSting food
and dispelling waste. This disc is
surrounded by a thicket of tendrils that vary in thickness
from fine, hairlike cilia to thick, swollen appendages. The
creature uses all of these tentacles at once when it attacks
prey. Like their smaller kin, giant sea anemones come in
a broad spectrum of colors-many are known for their
brilliant hues.
Giant sea anemones can move at a slow pace by walking
along the projections at their bases. More often, however,
these predators affix themselves to rock, coral, or sunken
objects like ships, then wait for prey to come to them.
As mindless creatures, giant sea anemones have no use
for treasure, but the remains of prey digested and then
expelled often litter the area around these creatures.
Massive sea anemones big enough to eat dolphins, whales,
or even sea serpents reportedly exist in the deepest parts of
the ocean. Called deep tigers for their alternating fronds
of black and brilliant orange, these giant sea anemones
are said to lair in undersea ruins and sunken ships, where
the promise of sought-after treasure conveniently lures in
a constant food supply.
Other species of sea anemones exist as well, some smaller
but most quite a bit larger and favoring different oceanic
regions and depths. You can adjust the stats for the giant
sea anemone by changing the Hit Dice and size (adjuSting
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to
represent a wide range of species. Often, different species
have additional abilities, such as the darkforest anemone's
constriction attack, or the deep tiger's ability to squirt
acid. The following table lists the most common variants.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dooming Gaze (Su) Paralyzed with fear for 1 round,
60 feet, Will DC 27 negates. A creature that is already
paralyzed by this gaze attack and fails a saving throw to
resist being paralyzed for 1 more round gains 1 negative
level (Fortitude DC 27 to remove after 24 hours). The
paralysis effect of this gaze is a mind-affecting fear
effect, but the negative level is not. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
The ocean knows few terrors as unnatural and horrific
as the sea bonze. This undead goliath dwells near
established shipping lanes or offshore from coastal
settlements, where it lurks just beneath the surface of
the water until it can strike unsuspecting boats in the
dead of night. Sailors often advise launching ocean
voyages only during the day on the assumption that
doing so might protect them from the sea bonze's
attention, but such tactics make little difference to
the creature itself, which will trail a particular ship
until after dusk, sometimes for hundreds of miles, only to
lurch out of the water and lay waste to an entire ship.
Sea bonzes are formed from the combined despair and
horror of death at sea, such as when a ship sinks and its
entire crew drowns. No single restless soul empowers a
sea bonze-it combines the anger and doom of all who die
in such close proximity. Reawakened as mammoth shipwreckers,
these angry spirits have no memory of their
past lives, and seek to inf lict the doom they suffered on
others who ply the seas. Their hatred does not make them
mindless, however, and more than one lucky crew member
has talked her entire ship's way out of total annihilation.
Sea bonzes have an unusual respect for those with wit and
guile, and will sometimes consider sparing those they deem
worthy of their esteem. Those who try to defend themselves
with brawn and weapons, however, receive no mercy from
the enormous monsters.
A sea bonze's f lesh is black and leathery like that of a
squid, and appears at first glance to be made out of the
black waters of the ocean itself. The entire creature is
featureless and smooth, making its empty visage all the
more horrifying.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Elusive (Ex) As a full-round action while in water, a deep sea
serpent can move up to its run speed (200 feet) without
leaving any trace of its passing (identical in effect to pass
without trace). An elusive deep sea serpent gains a +40
circumstance bonus on its Stealth check. In addition, except
when in combat, a sea serpent is considered to be under
the effects of a nondetection spell. Both of these effects
function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.
Powerful Tail (Ex) A deep sea serpent's tail slap is always a
primary attack. When a deep sea serpent deals damage to
an object with its tail slap or via constrict damage, it ignores
the first 10 points of hardness that object possesses.
Surge (Ex) A deep sea serpent can surge forward as a fullround
action at a speed of 400 feet. It must move in a
straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity
while surging.
An enormous monstrosity that makes its home in the
darkest depths of the ocean's trenches, the deep sea serpent
is as elusive as it is terrifying, the nightmare of sailors
making their ways over the vast and seemingly bottomless
waters. A deep sea serpent is rarely seen unless it wishes
to be seen, and the beast usually has its own mysterious
reasons for occasionally coming to the surface. At other
times, those reasons are gruesomely obvious-the deep
sea serpent rises to the surface to crush ships and devour
sailors who tumble from the freshly shattered hulls.
It is thought that in incredibly remote parts of the
underwater world, even more powerful deep sea serpents
exist, beasts with supernatural luminous lures that
can be used to blind foes, or with the ability to create
overwhelming blasts of electricity that stun or even
outright slay prey with a single stroke. Yet perhaps the
most unnerving are the rumors of deep sea serpents that
possess a remarkable intelligence. Such creatures, if they
even exist, are rarely if ever seen near the surface-both
their naturally elusive natures and the
remote reality of their habitats mean
that ensuring the veracity of
these claims requires truly
extraordinary efforts.
A typical deep sea
serpent measures 50
feet long and weighs
35,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Bay (Su) When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all
creatures within a 300-foot spread except evil outsiders
must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become panicked for
1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A
creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the
same mastiff's bay for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting
fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Shadow Blend (Su) In any condition of illumination other
than full daylight, a shadow mastiff disappears into the
shadows, giving it concealment (50% miss chance).
Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell,
does not negate this ability
a daylight spell, however,
does. A shadow mastiff can suspend or resume this ability
as a free action.
Tireless hunters, stealthy trackers, and deadly predators,
shadow mastiffs stalk the dark corners of the Outer Planes,
preying upon all beings that stray from the light. These
beasts have little in common with actual canines aside
from their general forms (although with the notable
addition of a long, spiked tail), their bodies being the
evolution of countless centuries hunting the most merciless
wildernesses of the Outer Planes and the Shadow Plane. On
the Material Plane, they prefer to travel in shadow, moving
soundlessly and unseen to find prey, hunting in vicious
sport just as often as in hunger. Shadow mastiffs stand over
4 feet tall, with most weighing nearly 300 pounds.
In combat, these stealthy beasts prefer to fight in
shadows
they shy from areas of bright light unless faced
with no other choice and use their bay to force their
enemies to f lee from well-lit areas. Shadow mastiffs prefer
to hunt in groups, using pack tactics to lure prey into
traps and to draw it away from sources of light. They do
not make lairs, and are usually not found with any sort of
treasure, unless it is on the body of a recently slain victim.
Shadow mastiffs are popular guardians among
spellcasters capable of conjuring them via lesser planar
ally or lesser planar binding. Undead spellcasters and evil
outsiders are immune to shadow mastiffs' fearful bay;
others who are not immune might intentionally expose
themselves to the creatures' bay at some point during the
daylight hours when the resulting panic won't directly
impact other tasks. As a general rule, it's safe to assume
that any site using shadow mastiffs as guardians has
already been affected by the bay, and that its inhabitants
are thus immune to the ability's effects for the remaining
24 hours of that day.
Larger shadow mastiffs exist-creatures the size of
horses or even bigger. These creatures have
different shapes, looking less like dogs
and more like larger creatures
such as lions, dinosaurs, or even
dragons. Such creatures have
additional racial Hit Dice,
and could even have extra
abilities such as f light
or breath weapons.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Cold (Su) A shae's touch
saps heat from living creatures,
leaving patches of colorless flesh rather
than physical wounds. A shae can deal 1d6 points of cold
damage with a touch. It adds +1d6 points of cold damage to
any melee weapon damage it deals.
Lesser Shadow Evocation (Sp) This spell-like ability functions
identically to the spell shadow evocation, but it can only
create quasi-real versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation
spells of 2nd level or lower. This spell-like ability is the
equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
The mysterious people known as the shaes are natives
of the Shadow Plane. In their own language, their name
means "unbound" or "unfettered." According to shae
history, they were once humanoids who through tireless
study and self-perfection managed to transcend the
bonds of a definite form. Though they still bear roughly
humanoid shapes, shaes' outlines are perpetually wispy
and impossible for any non-shaes to focus directly on.
Though shaes may engage in all the same pursuits and
professions as other humanoids, their overwhelming
racial pride often leads them to see all other humanoids-
especially humans-as lesser beings. Ironically, this
casual disdain sometimes leads individual shaes to
gather harems of worshipful human consorts, and it is
from these unions that fetchlings often issue. Humans
involved in such relationships often hope to learn the
secret of the shaes' power over shadows, and claim that
only in sacred union with the creatures can one glimpse
their true features.
Shaes are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds.
They often wear masks and form-fitting clothing when
around other creatures in order to give the lesser beings
something to focus on (such garments do not impede
their blur ability).

Prescience (Su) A shedu can see all the possible
outcomes of any of its own futures. This
grants the creature an insight bonus
to its 		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|
and on initiative checks and
Reflex saves equal to its Wisdom
bonus (+6 for most shedus).
Shedus live far from the hustle and bustle of humanity in
harsh deserts. There they populate caves, ruins, or ancient
temples reclaimed from the shifting sands. In these places
of refuge, shedus contemplate the struggle between good
and evil throughout the universe. Tireless vehicles of good
and kindness, shedus fight against outsiders who corrupt
and threaten humanity. Skilled in healing, shedus focus
on eliminating plagues, even hunting down outsiders and
undead working in that destructive medium.
Shedus rarely make their homes near each other. This
is not out of any sort of animosity, but rather from a feeling
that having two or more shedus within close proximity
wastes the opportunity to provide aid to a larger region.
When a shedu roams through the lands of another, it
always seeks out the local shedu for an opportunity to talk
and share knowledge over the course of 3 days. After this
period, the visiting shedu departs with a new perspective
and more points to ponder in its eternal struggle against
the evils of the world.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Destroy Soul (Su) A shinigami possesses six gems in which it
encapsulates souls with its soul bind spell-like ability. These
gems are only useful to the shinigami that owns them, and
if the shinigami dies, the gems are destroyed as well. As
a standard action once per day, a shinigami can hold up a
gem that currently contains a soul and crush it, permanently
destroying the soul within and releasing a 30-foot-radius
burst of negative energy that inflicts 1d6 negative levels
on all creatures in the area of effect. A successful DC 30
Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level. The soul
destroyed in the process of using this ability can only be
brought back to life by means of a miracle or wish spell. This
is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Feared as truly impartial and merciless harbingers of death,
shinigamis are relentless in their pursuit of dispensing
quick and just deaths upon those who would seek to disrupt
the delicate balance of life. Unlike other, more sinister
bringers of doom, shinigamis do not take pleasure in their
work and do not seek to impose suffering-although
there are exceptions. Some individuals, aptly described by
their kin as "rogue shinigamis," subscribe to either more
merciful or more despicable forms of execution, and are
either lawful good or lawful evil. Victims who have had
their lives spared by kind shinigamis praise the angels
of death for their clemency and willingness to listen to
the victims' plight, while other dastardly survivors have
successfully cheated or bribed their way out of death by
manipulating credulous or less honorable shinigami. A
shinigami is 9 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Aura of Peace (Su) Creatures within a 50-foot spread from
a simurgh feel a sensation of peace wash over them, as if
affected by calm emotions, except the simurgh can choose
which creatures are affected. A DC 28 Will save negates
the effects of this aura for 1 round, but a new save must
be made each round to continue to resist the effects. The
saving throw is Charisma-based.
Banishing Swipe
(Su) A simurgh
can use its radiant
tail to return creatures
to their native planes. In
addition to taking damage,
any extraplanar creature
touched by a simurgh's
tail must succeed at a DC 28
Will save or be affected as
if by banishment. A creature
that makes this save cannot
be affected by the same
simurgh's banishing swipe for
the next 24 hours. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Glaring Ray (Su) A simurgh can blast a
fiery ray of brilliant light from its eyes as
a standard action to a range of 100 feet.
Radiant Feathers (Su) Once per day as a
standard action, a simurgh can fan out its
glimmering tail feathers and blast its foes with a 100-foot
cone of radiant light from its tail. Aside from its size, this
attack is identical to a prismatic spray (DC 28). The save is
Charisma-based.
Regarded as living legends, simurghs are held in high
regard by desert dwellers. Those who live in the desert
lands where these benevolent creatures sometimes
reside consider it a lifetime's worth of luck even to spot
one soaring through the sky. Simurghs prefer to keep to
themselves, well out of the way of lesser creatures and their
often dubious morals, though they can be relied upon for
aid when called by those in true need and with a pure heart.
A simurgh can live for thousands of years, and frequent
mentions of these giant avian beings throughout a region's
historical record are more often than not sightings of the
same creature.

Stunning Shock (Su) A siyokoy can emit a strong electrical

the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be
stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Swim-By Attack (Ex) Extremely quick in the water, a siyokoy

Siyokoys are eel-like aquatic creatures often mistaken
for merfolk by sailors. On closer inspection, however,
siyokoys' appearance might make one question the vision
of said sailors, for apart from their humanoid arms,
siyokoys are very much creatures of the sea.

are concerned. The most commonly encountered
siyokoys are those that dwell amid the caves and crags
of coral reefs in relatively shallow oceanic waters. These
siyokoys tend to have colorful patterns on their f lesh
to mimic the riot of hues the typical coral reef
displays. Reef-dwelling siyokoys are fond of
decorating their lairs with particularly
strange or colorful specimens of
coral, especially when such
marine growths encrust
sunken treasures.
A siyokoy variant
that is encountered
less frequently
dwells in the
deeper abysses
of the ocean, far
below the limits
of the sun's
ability to light.
These siyokoys are
darker colored,
and they tend
to be darker in
personality as well. Whereas
those dwelling in the bright, sunlit
environs of a coral reef might be capricious
or playful, those who dwell in the dark, vast deeps of the
sea are often morbid, morose, and even sadistic. Most evil
siyokoys dwell in such lightless, forgotten reaches of the
world's oceans.
Regardless of where they dwell, siyokoys adore
shipwrecks and long-forgotten ruins claimed by the
oceans. Exploring these relics and recovering strange and
wondrous treasures is what most siyokoys live for, and a
siyokoy's lair is often decorated with the results of these
scavenging expeditions to sunken ships and f looded
cities. Strangely, siyokoys avoid making their lairs amid
such ruins, mostly out of a strange superstition the
creatures share about these areas-it is not lucky, say
siyokoys, to sleep in a place where air breathing creatures
have drowned.
A siyokoy is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Swooping Charge (Ex) A charging criosphinx
deals 4d4+12 points of damage with its Gore
attack. A flying criosphinx who drops
at least 20 feet in altitude as part of a
charge deals 6d4+18 points instead.
Perhaps the least leonine of
all sphinxes, the ram-headed
criosphinx lacks the intellect of
androsphinxes and gynosphinxes,
but still outmatches the dim-witted
hieracosphinxes. Like hieracosphinxes and
androsphinxes, criosphinxes are always male.
At the start of a battle, a criosphinx lowers its horns
and crashes into foes, clawing enemies it has engaged.
It favors charging down on foes from great heights.
Criosphinxes crave wealth over nearly all other things,
habitually extorting tolls for safe passage from any who pass
their lands. Groups who cannot pay must yield one of their
number or a pair of mounts for the criosphinx's meal-
single travelers must fight or die. Unlike gynosphinxes,
no mere riddle suffices-only the shine of metal or the
gleam of jewels can satisfy a criosphinx. Little can convince
a criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust
that its kind bears for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave
mating with gynosphinxes above all else, and pay well for
the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a well-crafted
riddle that might impress one. For their part, gynosphinxes
prefer to have little to do with what they mock as the sheep
of sphinxes, though they sometimes lower themselves to a
brief assignation in the rare event a criosphinx manages to
impress them with wealth or wit.
Some criosphinxes set themselves as soothsayers of the
desert, trading upon the storied wisdom of androsphinxes
and gynosphinxes to deceive gullible travelers. Like their
more blustering brethren, they seek wealth from passersby,
but for the purposes of dispersing information rather than
in exchange for safe passage. Such reliable information as
they possess usually comes from idle conversation with the
creatures of the desert, with criosphinxes using their inborn
ability to speak with animals. A criosphinx lacking in sound
information usually fabricates a pleasing lie.
Criosphinxes detest hieracosphinxes, regarding
them as little more than beasts and a disgrace to
their noble race. They drive off their falconheaded
cousins with mock-charges and
posturing, escalating to full-f ledged
attacks if ignored. Androsphinxes
they view with mixed fear and
respect, and gynosphinxes with
disdain and lust.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Shriek (Su) The shrill shriek of a hieracosphinx deafens nonsphinxes
within a 60-foot-radius spread for 2d4 rounds (DC
16 Fortitude negates). Once a creature successfully saves
against this effect, it is immune to the hieracosphinx's
shriek for 24 hours. Using this ability is a standard action.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
The least intelligent of the common sphinxes,
hieracosphinxes are a cowardly, cruel-hearted lot. All are
male. They despise the larger and cleverer androsphinxes
and criosphinxes. Toward gynosphinxes they hold a twisted
mix of a lust and hate, simultaneously envying their beauty
and power while craving them as mates. Hieracosphinxes
attack other sphinxes whenever they have them
at a disadvantage. Male sphinxes of other species they
tear to shreds or drive away, whereas they prefer to leave
gynosphinxes ravaged but alive. The other species of sphinx
likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and
typically attack these vile beasts on sight.
Hieracosphinxes guard their territory ruthlessly against
weaker intruders, seldom giving warning before they attack.
They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts
at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call
off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with
information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx.
Though poor f liers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the
better to escape if the combat turns against them.
As they lack the ego and resourcefulness of the rest of
their breed, hieracosphinxes can be pressed into service of
mounts, particularly by those of similarly evil dispositions.
Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but submit to
more powerful riders, though they still inf lict their foul
tempers on any weaker creatures that happen by. A grown
hieracosphinx can easily consume a full horse's worth of meat
in a day, making their upkeep rather expensive. Even with
these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command values of up
to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes.
It takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after
which an untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider
without magical compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come
by, charge thousands of gold pieces to rear and train a
hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and limb.
A light load for a hieracosphinx is up to 350
pounds
a medium load, 351-700 pounds;
and a heavy load, 701-1,050 pounds. A
typical hieracosphinx is just short of
9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.
Hieracosphinxes detest bearing a
rider into battle, thus increasing
the DCs of any combat-related
Ride checks by +5.

This pale yellow spider's legs protrude on either side, giving it a
very distinctive stance. The thing is the size of a large dog.

Giant crab spiders are dangerous
ambush predators that live in
dense forest vegetation.
Though crab spiders
are not web spinners,
they are truly gifted
climbers and use
this talent to clamber
up into places where
they can observe
wide areas from
on high. Named for
their curious
scuttling walk
and wide-legged
stance, giant
crab spiders
are rarely larger
than a typical
adult half ling.
Spider, Ogre
This towering spider is the size of an elephant. Its legs have spiky
joints and its face looks vaguely, but disturbingly, humanoid.
