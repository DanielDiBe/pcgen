Default Traits ~ Adaro		CATEGORY:Internal		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=AdaroRacial

Poison	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	KEY:Poison ~ Adaro	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AdaroRacial	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Adaros favor a paralytic toxin secreted by the flying nettlefin pufferfish-a sticky venom that doesn't wash away in water. Nettlefin Toxin: Spear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/minute for 4 minutes; effect paralyzed for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Poison Use	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	KEY:Poison Use ~ Adaro	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.AdaroRacial	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Adaros are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves.
Rain Frenzy	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	KEY:Rain Frenzy ~ Adaro	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.AdaroRacial	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Adaros revere storms, and their lust for blood is amplified exponentially while it is raining. While fighting in the rain or during other stormy weather, adaros act as though affected by the rage spell. An adaro gains this benefit even if it is underwater, but only as long as it remains within a move action away from the water's surface (50 feet for most adaros).
Speak with Sharks	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	KEY:Speak with Sharks ~ Adaro	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.AdaroRacial	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:An adaro can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 100 feet.

#Adherer 8
Default Traits ~ Adherer		CATEGORY:Internal		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Adhesive ~ Adherer
Adhesive	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	KEY:Adhesive ~ Adherer	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A weapon that strikes an adherer becomes stuck fast to the creature's adhesive flesh unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save. A creature adjacent to the adherer can attempt to pry off a stuck weapon with a DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the adherer. The adherer's adhesive flesh gives it a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks. It can attempt to grapple a foe as a free action whenever a creature successfully hits it with a natural attack or an unarmed strike. An adherer does not gain the grappled condition when it grapples a foe, nor does it provoke attacks of opportunity when it attempts to do so. Fire can temporarily burn away an adherer's adhesive coating-whenever an adherer takes at least 10 points of fire damage, it loses its adhesive special quality for 1d4 rounds. Universal solvent, alchemical solvent, or a similar fluid removes an adherer's adhesive quality for 1 hour if it fails a DC 15 Reflex save, or for 1d4 rounds if it makes the save. The adherer's skin loses its adhesive quality 1 hour after the adherer dies. An adherer can release anything stuck to it as a free action. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. While a target is fascinated, the allip can approach it without breaking the effect, but an attack by the allip does end the effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip's babble for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charismabased.

Creating a sand trap takes 1 hour. A DC 15 Perception check allows a creature to realize such a depression in the sand is in fact a trap. Any creature that steps into the trap slides to the center if it fails a DC 14 Reflex save-such victims take no damage, but they do fall prone. A giant ant lion can make an attack of opportunity against any creature that falls to the bottom of its sand trap. These creatures can move across sand traps at their normal speed and are immune to the trap's effects. Other creatures can navigate the trap's walls with a DC 20 Climb check.

Disassemble	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	KEY:Disassemble ~ Harbinger Archon	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a move-equivalent action, a harbinger can break apart into its components.

Dual Mind	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	KEY:Dual Mind ~ Adhukait	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:An adhukait is a single creature with two distinct minds, so it can attempt two saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

Spirit Blades	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	KEY:Spirit Blades ~ Asurendra	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a swift action, an asurendra can call forth up to six longsword-shaped force effects that float near the asurendra until directed. The asurendra can use a standard action to direct one blade to attack a target up to a distance of 50 feet away, or use a full-attack action to cause all six blades to attack up to six different targets up to a distance of 50 feet away, each to a different location if desired. Once an asurendra directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the asurendra's turn until directed otherwise by the asurendra and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the asurendra. As a move action, the asurendra can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the asurendra's base attack bonus modified by its Wisdom modifier (+29 for most asurendras), and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the asurendra's Wisdom modifier (3d6+7 for most asurendras). Physical attacks do no affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the asurendra does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes. Likewise, any blades that are not within 50 feet of the asurendra at the end of its turn also vanish.

To control a vermin, the azruverda must be able to see it, and it must be within 120 feet. Attempting to control a vermin is a standard action-the vermin can resist this attempt with a DC 25 Will save. If the vermin fails this save, the azruverda can issue a simple mental command like "fight," "come here," "go there," or "stand still" as a swift action. Though composed of thousands of individuals, vermin with the swarm subtype are vulnerable to this ability as well. An azruverda can release a creature from this control as a free action.

Alternatively, the baku can feed upon the dreams of a creature that it manages to contact with its dream spell-like ability. A creature can resist this effect with a DC 22 Will save. When a baku feeds in this way, it can elect to consume only nightmares or all dreams. If it only consumes nightmares, the target creature is immune to the effects of the nightmare spell, the dream haunting ability of the night hag, and other similar attacks for that period of sleep. If the baku instead feeds on all of the creature's dreams, that creature is fatigued upon waking and does not gain any benefits it would have received from sleep, such as natural healing or the ability to regain spells after resting. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Mental Drain	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	KEY:Mental Drain ~ Baku	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When a baku attacks with a claw, it can choose, as a swift action, to deal 1d4 points of Intelligence damage on that attack.

Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d10+6 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Planar Acclimation	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	KEY:Planar Acclimation ~ Bandersnatch	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A bandersnatch is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.

Furthermore, a bandersnatch affected by ability damage, ability drain, or a mind-affecting effect that allows a save receives a single additional save against the effect of its choice at the original DC at the end of its turn in order to shake off the effect.

A dying creature can resist this attack with a DC 19 Fortitude save. If it fails, the target is instantly slain. If the creature is already dead, it does not make a saving throw, although the body cannot be more than 1 hour dead. A creature subjected to this attack cannot be brought back to life via raise dead (resurrection and more powerful effects work normally). When a baykok devours a soul in this way, it heals 5d6+10 points of damage and becomes hasted for 4 rounds (as if affected by haste). This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Infused Arrows	SOURCEPAGE:p.35	KEY:Infused Arrows ~ Baykok	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A baykok creates arrows of bone as it fires its bow-it need not carry arrows as ammunition.

Further, the first creature struck in a round by a baykok's arrow must make a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid being paralyzed for 1d3 rounds.

#Berbalang 40
Projection	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	KEY:Projection ~ Berbalang	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Once per day as a full-round action, a berbalang can enter a trance that separates the creature's spirit from its body. This splits the berbalang's current hit points in half between its body and its spirit. The berbalang's spirit body gains the incorporeal subtype and special ability; otherwise, it retains the same statistics as its physical self with the following changes: AC 19, touch 19, flat-footed 10 (+4 Dex, +4 deflection, +1 dodge), single incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d4 Constitution damage on a hit as its sole attack. This spirit projection can travel no more than 1 mile away from the berbalang's body. Because the creature is only partially in existence when in this state, its body gains displacement as the spell. When separated in this way, the berbalang's body is unconscious and helpless. If the berbalang's body is injured while in this state, the separated projection immediately returns to its body, and the body loses displacement. If the physical body is slain, the spirit body immediately dies as well. If the spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it returns to the body immediately. A berbalang in spirit form can end the effect at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit immediately returns to the body. When a berbalang's spirit form returns to the body, add both the spirit body's hit points and the physical body's hit points back together to determine the creature's current hit point total.

This aura manifests as a shifting haze of images that reflect the viewer's deepest fears. The first time it ends its turn within the aura, a creature must make a DC 25 Will save or become shaken for as long as it stays within the aura. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
Striking Fear	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	KEY:Striking Fear ~ Bogeyman	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:If a bogeyman confirms a critical hit or a sneak attack with one of its claws on a target currently suffering a fear effect, that effect automatically becomes one step more severe (shaken creatures become frightened, frightened creatures become panicked, and panicked creatures cower in fear). A DC 25 Will save negates this increase. In addition, a critical hit from the bogeyman's claw forces any target that has successfully saved against the creature's fear aura to make another Will save against its effects, even if 24 hours have not yet passed. This is a fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
Terrible Rejuvenation	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	KEY:Terrible Rejuvenation ~ Bogeyman	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A bogeyman gains fast healing 5 while any creature within its deepest fear aura is suffering from a fear effect, including any fear effect created by the aura itself.

#Carbuncle 44
Empath	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	KEY:Empath ~ Carbuncle	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Carbuncles possess a crude form of telepathy, allowing them to transmit mild impressions and remembered sensations to other creatures. This form of telepathy cannot convey language or hinder a target in any way (such as by transmitting pain).

Specious Suggestion	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	KEY:Specious Suggestion ~ Carbuncle	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a standard action three times per day, a carbuncle can concentrate intently on one creature within its line of sight and attempt to impose its will upon the target. A DC 11 Will save is enough to resist this compulsion. If the target fails to resist, roll 1d6. On a result of 1-2, the target gains a flash of insight and a +2 insight bonus to its Armor Class for 1 minute. On a result of 3-4, the victim is affected as if by suggestion for 1 minute, and must follow a single (usually embarrassing, always harmless) suggestion from the carbuncle. On a result of 5-6, the victim's thoughts are garbled with those of the carbuncle, imposing a -2 penalty to the victim's Will saving throws for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Vulnerability to Suggestion	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	KEY:Vulnerability to Suggestion ~ Carbuncle	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Any mind-affecting spell can affect a carbuncle regardless of creature type limitations.

This ability functions at CL 7th (or at the highest CL available to the most powerful caulborn in the group). The save DC is Charisma-based, adjusted by the modifier of the caulborn with the highest Charisma score.
Hive Mind	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	KEY:Hive Mind ~ Caulborn	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As long as there are at least two caulborn within 300 feet of each other, if one caulborn in the group is aware of a particular danger, they all are.

#Ceratioidi 50
Dual Mind	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	KEY:Dual Mind ~ Ceratioidi	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:The fact that each ceratioidi is actually two creatures sharing the same body gives it a number of unique abilities. A ceratioidi can delegate various actions and physical processes to the individual minds, allowing it to fight with two weapons simultaneously without any penalties. It can also select two favored classes. The telepathic tangle between its twin consciousnesses makes a ceratioidi impervious to mind-affecting effects.
Lure	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	KEY:Lure ~ Ceratioidi	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a free action, a ceratioidi can light the dangling lure on its forehead, forcing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 Will save or become fascinated for 1 round.

The target creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save, or it becomes dazed for 1 round per caster level (4 rounds for most cerebric fungi).

Unsettling Appearance	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	KEY:Unsettling Appearance ~ Cerebric Fungus	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A cerebric fungus constantly scans the minds of those around it, projecting around itself a confusing collage of images gleaned from their thoughts.

#Clockwork Spy 58
Record Audio	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	KEY:Record Audio ~ Clockwork Spy	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A clockwork spy can record nearby sounds as a swift action, archiving all sound within a 20-foot spread onto a small gemstone worth 50 gp embedded in its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound per Hit Die it possesses. Starting and stopping playback of recorded sound is a swift action. Removing a gemstone or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a DC 25 Disable Device check as a full-round action-failure does not damage the gemstone but does erase any recorded sounds on the gemstone. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and subtypes, but not between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to start recording sound as soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes in range, but it cannot be ordered to start recording when a specific person comes within range. Once a clockwork spy begins recording sound, it cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot record sound onto a gemstone that already contains a recording.
Self-Destruct	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	KEY:Self-Destruct ~ Clockwork Spy	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Unless specifically programmed otherwise by its creator, a clockwork spy explodes 1 round after it is destroyed. During this round, the thing shrieks and thrashes about as if undergoing convulsions. On what would normally have been the clockwork spy's next action, it explodes, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage in a 5-foot radius (Reflex DC 10 for half damage). A DC 20 Disable Device check made as a standard action can halt the spy's self-destruct sequence, but does not prevent it from dying. A clockwork spy that self-destructs automatically destroys its gemstone, along with any information contained inside it. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Crucidaemon (daemon) 62
Chained Daggers	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	KEY:Chained Daggers ~ Crucidaemon	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A crucidaemon fights with the two daggers chained to its wrists as if dual wielding daggers with a reach of 10 feet (although it can also attack adjacent foes with no penalty). It takes no penalty on attack or damage rolls while wielding both of these daggers at once. These daggers are considered to be +2 daggers that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage.

#Deathtrap Ooze 64
Acid	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	KEY:Acid ~ Deathtrap Ooze	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A deathtrap ooze secretes acid that dissolves only flesh. Creatures made of materials other than flesh are immune to this acid.
Trap Form	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	KEY:Trap Form ~ Deathtrap Ooze	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Taking 1 minute to do so, a deathtrap ooze can assume the form of any Medium or Large mechanical trap that has no more than one moving part (excluding pits). The ooze can maintain this form indefinitely. The trap it can assume the form of must be of a CR equal to or less than that of the deathtrap ooze itself-appropriate traps from pages 420-421 of the Core Rulebook include the swinging axe trap (CR 1), the wall scythe trap (CR 4), and the falling block trap (CR 5). In trap form, the ooze uses its attack bonus, but otherwise functions as the emulated trap and uses that trap's statistics and damage. If a creature searching for traps exceeds the DC to find the ooze's trap form, a successful follow-up DC 19 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check allows the creature that discovered the trap to discern its true nature. If the ooze takes any damage, it reverts to its normal form as a free action. Otherwise, reverting to its normal form takes a swift action.

#Demilich 66-67
Devour Soul	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	KEY:Devour Soul ~ Demilich	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a standard action with a range of 300 feet, a demilich can imprison the soul of a living creature within one of 10 special gems embedded in its skull. If the target succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save, it gains two permanent negative levels. If it fails, its soul is immediately drawn into one of the gems in the demilich's skull. The soul remains trapped within the gem, visible as but a gleam except under true seeing. The soulless body corrupts and decays rapidly, reducing to dust in a single round. As long as the dead creature's soul remains trapped in the gemstone, it cannot be restored to life via any means save direct divine intervention. Gems with souls trapped in them can be retrieved from a destroyed demilich, at which point they can either be crushed to release any souls within to their afterlife or used in the place of the usual material components to restore the soul and body with resurrection or true resurrection. After 24 hours, the demilich can choose to consume any soul trapped in a gem, healing it 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the soul, at which point only miracle or wish can restore the dead creature to life. The save DC is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 bonus for the Ability Focus feat.
Greater Bestow Curse	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	KEY:Greater Bestow Curse ~ Demilich	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:This spell-like ability functions like bestow curse, but can have one of the following effects: -12 to one ability score; -6 to two ability scores; -8 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks; or a 25% chance to act normally.

Immunity to Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	KEY:Immunity to Magic ~ Demilich	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A demilich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below. . A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw. . Holy smite affects a demilich normally. . A power word kill spoken by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demilich if it fails a Fortitude save (with a DC determined as though the spell allowed a saving throw). . A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw.
Rejuvenation	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	KEY:Rejuvenation ~ Demilich	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A destroyed demilich reforms in 2d6 days.

Telekinetic Storm	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	KEY:Telekinetic Storm ~ Demilich	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a special use of its telekinesis spell-like ability, a demilich can churn up its treasure, dust, bones, and other loose debris in the area into a whirling storm about its skull. The storm obscures vision as a fog cloud within a 20-foot spread centered on the demilich's skull. Creatures within the storm take 12d6 points of damage per round on the demilich's turn (Reflex DC 20 for half damage). The demilich can maintain the storm indefinitely by concentrating.

Adhesion	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	KEY:Adhesion ~ Tarry	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A creature striking a tarry demodand with a manufactured weapon must make a DC 23 Reflex save; failure means the weapon sticks to the demodand and cannot be used to make attacks until freed.

All creatures within 30 feet that can see the coloxus must make a DC 24 Will save or be slowed for up to 6 rounds. Each subsequent round, the coloxus must take a swift action to maintain the effect or the effect ceases at the end of its turn. Additionally, the sound creates a buffer against sonic energy, granting the fly demon immunity to sonic attacks or effects while it continues to drone. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#Derhii 75 - Done
Aerial Charge	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	KEY:Aerial Charge ~ Derhii	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When airborne, a derhii can dive at twice its normal flying speed. This is the equivalent of a charge, granting a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a -2 penalty to AC.
Booming Voice	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	KEY:Booming Voice ~ Derhii	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A derhii can use its own booming voice as a signal. The sound can be heard up to 12 miles away as a thrumming in the air that conveys 20 words of information in 5 minutes.

Default Traits ~ 	CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|
#Contract Devil 76-77
Binding Contract	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	KEY:Binding Contract ~ Contract Devil	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:All contract devils carry numerous lengthy contracts draped over their horns or within their numerous carrying cases. They can wield these contracts like whips, but deal lethal damage regardless of the armor bonus of their target. A contract devil modifies attack and damage rolls when using a binding contract by its Intelligence modifier, not its Strength modifier (this equates to a +7 bonus for most contract devils). Wounds created by a binding contract resemble horrifically deep paper cuts and cause 1d6 points of bleed damage. A contract devil can use its binding contract to disarm and trip foes as if the contract were a whip. If it is itself disarmed of the contract, the devil can rearm itself with a new contract as an immediate action.
Impale	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	KEY:Impale ~ Contract Devil	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a swift action, a contract devil can impale an opponent grappled by its binding contract, dealing 2d8+4 points of piercing damage.
Infernal Contract	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	KEY:Infernal Contract ~ Contract Devil	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a full-round action, a contract devil can produce an infernal contract for a single living mortal creature. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, as detailed on the following page. To receive any of these bonuses, however, the mortal must sign its true name to the document of its own free will. Upon doing so, that mortal's soul is sworn to the contract devil, condemning the soul to an eternity of servitude in Hell rather than whatever fate would naturally befall it upon the mortal's death. Breaking a contract with a contract devil is difficult and dangerous (see the next page); as long as the infernal contract remains in effect, the victim cannot be restored to life after death save by a miracle or a wish. If a mortal is restored to life in this way, the contract devil immediately senses the development-it not only knows which soul has been restored to life, but also gains the benefits of a discern location spell targeted on the character or creature that restored the damned soul to life.
Infernal Investment	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	KEY:Infernal Investment ~ Contract Devil	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a subclause of all infernal contracts, a contract devil can use greater scrying at will upon any creature it has a contract with. The target creature always fails its save against the devil's scrying attempt-this ability otherwise functions at caster level 20th.

#Pachycephalosaurus 79
Clobbering Charge	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	KEY:Clobbering Charge ~ Pachycephalosaurus	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When a pachycephalosaurus hits a target with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it can initiate a bull rush as a free action to move the struck target back in the same direction as the dinosaur's charge. The pachycephalosaurus cannot move with the target of the bull rush. If a pachycephalosaurus scores a critical hit against a creature with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it also staggers the target for 1 round. If the victim succeeds at a DC 18 Fortitude save, the stagger effect is negated, but the victim still suffers the effects of the dinosaur's bull rush attempt. The save DC is Strength-based.

#Dire Corby 80

#Disenchanter 81
Disenchant	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	KEY:Disenchant ~ Disenchanter	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A disenchanter can use its trunk to make a melee touch attack against a target's worn, held, or carried magic item in an attempt to drink the item's magic. The disenchanter makes a caster level check (+4) opposed by the target's Fortitude save. If the check succeeds, the disenchanter drains the item's magic, rendering it nonmagical. To determine which of a target's magic items is affected, use Table 9-2 on page 216 of the Core Rulebook (though a disenchanter never uses this ability on a headband or similar head-slot item unless it has first tried to wear the item). Disenchanters may instead target specific visible items, in which case they generally target the most obvious items. Artifacts are immune to this ability. Disenchant only works against objects that a disenchanter can touch, and even a thin layer of cloth effectively protects items from it.
Power Spray	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	KEY:Power Spray ~ Disenchanter	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Once per day, a disenchanter can release a 20-foot cone-shaped burst of raw magical energy through its trunk. Creatures in the cone take 4d6 points of damage (DC 14 Reflex save for half ). Creatures immune to magic effects that allow spell resistance (such as golems) are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Vulnerable to Dispel Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	KEY:Vulnerable to Dispel Magic ~ Disenchanter	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A disenchanter targeted by dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6, Fortitude save for half). Greater dispel magic functions similarly (maximum 20d6 damage, Fortitude save for half).

This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Create Ghul	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	KEY:Create Ghul ~ Akvan	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4 rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become freewilled ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
Shake Faith	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	KEY:Shake Faith ~ Akvan	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds.

The akvan chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan's stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.

#Pairaka 88
Disease	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	KEY:Disease ~ Pairaka	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A pairaka carries two diseases.

Lustful Dreams	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	KEY:Lustful Dreams ~ Pairaka	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Pairakas can torment sleeping creatures. While an intelligent creature sleeps, a pairaka can slip into the target's mind and twist its dreams to lusty nocturnal visions. The victim must be asleep for the pairaka to use this ability and the pairaka must be within 100 feet. If the victim fails a DC 21 Will save, it experiences vivid hallucinations of a lurid nature that leave it breathless and fatigued upon waking. The victim, even a depraved soul, rarely considers the sexual nature of these dreams enjoyable, as the images exploit any number of taboos the pairaka suspects its victim might harbor. The save DC is Charisma-based. Creatures that do not sleep or dream are immune to this effect.

Doing so causes the globster 1d6 points of damage, but creates a new, fully grown globster that immediately attacks the nearest non-globster target.

If the check fails, the target is still trapped but takes no damage. The target can escape the grapple normally, or can break out of the bones by dealing 15 points of damage to the prison, which has the same AC, DR, and saves as the bone golem itself. Damage to the prison has no effect on the golem. The golem can only have one bone prison active at a time.

A bone golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage. . A raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell negates its DR and immunity to magic for 1 minute.

Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's DR, resistances, and immunities may negate some or all of this damage. When a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it effectively transforms the corpse into a zombie of the appropriate size under the swarm's control. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster. Hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour. A hellwasp-inhabited creature is easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of the insects inside. A swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host. A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.

Toss	SOURCEPAGE:p.148	KEY:Toss ~ Hodag	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A hodag charging 20 feet or more that damages a foe with an attack can throw its foe with a special combat maneuver check. The opponent must be corporeal and at least one size category smaller than the hodag. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the hodag's opponent is thrown 10 feet through the air in a direction chosen by the hodag and falls prone. The hodag can only toss its opponent in a straight line. If an obstacle prevents the creature's movement, both the creature tossed and the object struck take 1d6 points of damage, and the creature falls prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. A hodag can also toss an opponent 10 feet up into the air. The victim lands in the same square it started in, falls prone, and takes 1d6 points of damage.
Trackless	SOURCEPAGE:p.148	KEY:Trackless ~ Hodag	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A hodag sweeps its tail behind itself in a way that obscures its tracks. Attempts to track a hodag have their normal DC increased by +10.

Desiccation Aura	SOURCEPAGE:p.149	KEY:Desiccation Aura ~ Hollow Serpent	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A cloud of moisture-draining dust fills the air in a 30-foot radius around a hollow serpent. Living creatures within this area must make a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage as water is leached from their flesh. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected again by the same hollow serpent's desiccation aura for 24 hours. Creatures without fleshy bodies are immune to this aura, while creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Life-Draining Coils	SOURCEPAGE:p.149	KEY:Life-Draining Coils ~ Hollow Serpent	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A hollow serpent seethes with negative energy capable of sapping the life force of creatures trapped within its coils.

False Humanity	SOURCEPAGE:p.150	KEY:False Humanity ~ Huecuva	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:During the day, a huecuva is cloaked in an illusion that makes it look, sound, and feel like the living creature it once was. This effect functions similarly to disguise self-if a creature interacts directly with a huecuva, it can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the illusion. Regardless, the huecuva's scent never changes-it always exudes a faint stench of grave dust and decay. Creatures with the scent ability receive a +4 bonus on any Will saving throw made to see through this illusion. At night (regardless of whether the huecuva itself knows night has fallen) this illusion fades and reveals the creature for what it truly is. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Enveloping Mists	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	KEY:Enveloping Mists ~ Hungry Fog	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A hungry fog can engulf foes (see Universal Monster Rules in the Appendices). A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is staggered in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to avoid the enveloping mists is Constitution-based.
Gaseous	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	KEY:Gaseous ~ Hungry Fog	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist.

Tursas: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Wis damage and 1d6 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as a victim suffers any ability damage from tursas, it gains the ability to breathe water. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma by this disease transforms into a fully grown and healthy ikuturso- it immediately forgets its previous life and abilities and seeks out the nearest iku-turso community to join it. A wish or miracle can reverse this transformation. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Light Lure	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	KEY:Light Lure ~ Iku-Turso	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a standard action, an iku-turso can call forth a few small points of light, functioning like a dancing lights spell (CL equals the iku-turso's HD) except as described here. Creatures within 100 feet of one of these lights must make a DC 18 Will save upon sighting them or be compelled to approach them by the safest and most direct path. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same iku-turso's light lure for 24 hours. If a subject of this effect has to move through hazardous terrain to reach the lights, that subject receives another saving throw to end the effect before entering the hazardous terrain. This effect ends once the character reaches the light or takes any form of damage. This is a visual mindaffecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Its natural form is that of a jackal, but it can also take the form of a human or a human-jackal hybrid. A jackalwere's human form is fixed-it cannot assume different human forms. A jackalwere can use its sleep gaze in any of its forms. In jackal form, it functions as a dog (Bestiary 87). In its hybrid form, a jackalwere can make a bite attack as a secondary attack, while in human form it lacks its bite attack entirely. A jackalwere can shift into any of its three alternate forms as a move action. Equipment does not meld with the new form between human and hybrid forms but does between those forms and its jackal form.
Jackal Empathy	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	KEY:Jackal Empathy ~ Jackalwere	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A jackalwere can communicate and empathize with jackals (use stats for Small dog; see Bestiary 87), and can use Bluff as if it were Diplomacy to change a jackal's attitude, receiving a +4 racial bonus to do so.

Spider Empathy	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	KEY:Spider Empathy ~ Jorogumo	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that it works only on spiders. A jorogumo gains a racial bonus on this check equal to her Hit Dice (normally +14). Spiders are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the jorogumo to train them and use them as guardians (though it does not grant them skills or feats).
Spider Legs	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	KEY:Spider Legs ~ Jorogumo	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A jorogumo's spider legs can emerge or retract as a free action.

#Jubjub Bird 157
Adaptive Defense	SOURCEPAGE:p.157	KEY:Adaptive Defense ~ Jubjub Bird	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When first encountered, a jubjub bird has no energy resistance. When damaged by an attack that causes cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, it gains resistance 30 to that energy type until the end of its next turn.

Deadly Bite	SOURCEPAGE:p.157	KEY:Deadly Bite ~ Jubjub Bird	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A jubjub bird applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its bite attack. A successful critical hit decapitates and instantly slays a Large or smaller victim (DC 33 Fortitude negates decapitation; creatures without a head are immune to this effect) and deals triple normal damage regardless of the decapitation result. The save DC is Strength-based.
Planar Acclimation	SOURCEPAGE:p.157	KEY:Planar Acclimation ~ Jubjub Bird	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A jubjub bird is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.

If a jinushigami is within its regional ward, it can create a Gargantuan quarterstaff out of the surrounding terrain as a standard action.
Manipulate Terrain	SOURCEPAGE:p.160	KEY:Manipulate Terrain ~ Jinushigami	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A jinushigami can help any number of creatures travel within its territory. Creatures aided in this way receive a +10 bonus on Survival checks and do not suffer reductions to overland movement from terrain or lack of a highway or other roadway, regardless of the presence of roads or the type of terrain they actually travel through. Alternatively, a jinushigami can make terrain more difficult for any number of creatures to travel through, imparting a -10 penalty on all Survival checks and causing overland movement to be reduced to one-tenth its normal speed. A jinushigami can affect as many creatures as it wishes with this ability, selecting whether it aids or impedes travel for each, as long as it can notice the creature and the creature is within its regional ward. A jinushigami may use this ability while merged with its ward.
Ward	SOURCEPAGE:p.160	KEY:Ward ~ Jinushigami	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A jinushigami treats an entire region as its ward. This region can be a single forest, swamp, mountain, lake, or any other natural feature, with a maximum radius of 5 miles. Most jinushigami have smaller regional wards, since not all regions are large enough to fill this area, but no region with a radius smaller than 1 mile radius can support (or deserves) a jinushigami. As long as it is within its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this way. As a standard action, it can convey information about a creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.

# Shikigami 163
Improvised Weapon Mastery	SOURCEPAGE:p.163	KEY:Improvised Weapon Mastery ~ Shikigami	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A shikigami gains Catch Off-Guard and Throw Anything as bonus feats, and adds its Charisma modifier instead of its Strength modifier to damage done with any improvised weapon, as attacks it makes with such weapons seem supernaturally lucky in landing damaging blows. Although a shikigami is Tiny, it never provokes attacks of opportunity when it attacks an adjacent foe with a melee weapon. If a shikigami critically hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, it deals ?3 damage.

#Toshigami 164
Touch of Ages	SOURCEPAGE:p.164	KEY:Touch of Ages ~ Toshigami	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Holy Weapons	SOURCEPAGE:p.165	KEY:Holy Weapons ~ Zuishin	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Any weapon wielded by a zuishin is treated as if it had the holy special ability. A zuishin creates arrows out of nothing as part of its attacks with any bow it wields.

#Kappa 166
Head Bowl	SOURCEPAGE:p.166	KEY:Head Bowl ~ Kappa	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:The basin atop a kappa's head contains water from its home river or lake. The water is emptied only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a creature pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple check while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa becomes immobile and staggered. It can still take actions, but it cannot move from the spot on its own. If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the kappa recovers from this condition immediately. This replacement water doesn't have to be from the kappa's home, but the kappa refills its head bowl from there at its first opportunity.

The victim can resist this effect with a DC 28 Fortitude save. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Doing so grants the eremite the effects of a heal and a greater restoration spell (caster level 20th).

A manananggal must return to its lower torso and reattach to it (a full-round action) within the hour before sunrise-each round a manananggal remains separated after sunrise, it takes 1d6 points of damage until it rejoins its lower torso or it crumbles into dust.

Void Form	SOURCEPAGE:p.210	KEY:Void Form ~ Void Yai	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A void yai may become incorporeal as a swift action. In this form, it appears as a solid black shadow of its true form. It gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal defensive ability while in void form. Any gear or armor the yai carries becomes incorporeal as well-it loses its AC bonus from armor and natural armor, but gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier (+7 for most void yai, for an AC of 16). It may still speak while incorporeal and can still use its spell-like and special abilities.

Void Trap	SOURCEPAGE:p.210	KEY:Void Trap ~ Void Yai	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When a void oni uses any teleportation effect on itself (including its greater teleport and plane shift spelllike abilities, but not its teleport object spell-like ability), it can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the closest Tiny or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A pistol has a range increment of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range of up to 20 feet, a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's pistols supernaturally reload the instant it fires them, allowing the undead to make multiple attacks in a round with the weapons. In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes of determining penalties from twoweapon fighting. Further rules for pistols, and firearms in general, can be found in Ultimate Combat.

On a failed save, the infested creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round as the rot grubs burrow through and consume its flesh-this effect continues as long as the victim remains in the swarm and continues for 1d6 rounds after it leaves the swarm. Any energybased attack (including damage from negative energy) that deals at least 5 points of damage to the victim automatically destroys all of the rot grubs infesting it, ending the effect prematurely. Additionally, any effect that removes disease instantly ends a rot grub infestation. Immunity to disease offers no defense. The save DC is Constitutionbased.

#Phantom Fungus 219
Phantom Flesh	SOURCEPAGE:p.219	KEY:Phantom Flesh ~ Phantom Fungus	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a move action, a phantom fungus can turn invisible as if using greater invisibility (caster level 4th). A moment after it attacks with invisibility, the creature appears briefly as a semitransparent version of its normal self. This allows any viewer with line of sight to the phantom fungus to pinpoint its location at the time of the attack (though if the creature moves after it attacks, opponents have to pinpoint it again). An opponent can ready an action to strike at the fungus when it momentarily appears, in which case the creature only has concealment instead of invisibility (20% miss chance). The fungus can turn completely visible as a move action, though it normally remains invisible all the time. If killed while invisible, it becomes visible 1d4 minutes later.

At the start of the ooze's turn as a free action, the ooze makes a combat maneuver check against all metallic creatures, all creatures wearing metal armor, and all creatures wielding metal weapons within 30 feet. If it beats the CMD of a metal or armored creature with this check, that creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze and cannot move away from the ooze for 1 round. If this causes the creature to move into a square occupied by the plasma ooze, the ooze can attempt to engulf that creature as a free action. If it beats the CMD of a creature wielding a metal weapon, that weapon is disarmed and pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze. Unattended metal objects of size Large or smaller are automatically pulled toward a plasma ooze. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.

Any magical effect that removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or heal) also destroys the egg, but mere immunity to paralysis or disease does not offer protection.

#Taotieh 260
Swallow Whole	SOURCEPAGE:p.260	KEY:Swallow Whole ~ Taotieh	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A taotieh can expand its jaws to swallow Large or smaller creatures.

Creatures do not take damage within this pocket dimension, but there is only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk suffocation. A creature that attempts to carve its way out of this dimension with a weapon must be able to penetrate the surrounding walls' hardness 8. When a creature manages to cut its way out of this dimension, it appears to leap out of the taotieh's mouth to emerge into any square adjacent to the taotieh's space-no actual hole is created in the creature, and new creatures that are swallowed later must cut their own way out. When a taotieh is destroyed, its body bursts open to allow the contents of its extradimensional stomachs to spill out into adjacent spaces.

A thriae queen using this ability can control the purity of the merope she launches, which makes it either harm those it touches or heal them. If a thriae queen chooses to make her merope harmful, all creatures in the area of effect take 20d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 29 for half ). In addition, any creature in the area of effect is also staggered for 1d4 rounds (or 1 round if it succeeds at its Reflex save). If she uses it to heal, the merope heals all living creatures in the area of effect for 10d8 points of damage. A thriae queen can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Merope Coat	SOURCEPAGE:p.264	KEY:Merope Coat ~ Thriae Queen	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A thriae queen is covered in a thin layer of merope. This coating acts as a magical barrier between spells cast at the thriae queen, as though she were constantly under the effects of spell turning. The coat affects a maximum of eight spell levels-when a spell effect is turned, this coating is depleted by a number of spell levels equal to the level of the spell reflected. The queen regenerates this coating at a rate of one spell level per round. A spell in excess of what the merope coat can currently reflect is not reflected, and reduces the merope coat to a score of 0. Spells that fail to penetrate the queen's spell resistance do not reduce the merope coat's efficiency in this manner.

Instead, when the titan attacks with its weapons, it rolls its attacks normally (either one attack for a standard action, or four as a full-round action) and hits every creature in its reach each time an attack roll exceeds that creature's AC. If any such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the critical is applied to one creature of the hekatonkheires's choosing. The hekatonkheires can choose to deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage as a free action on each separate hit.

#Tophet 271
Conductive	SOURCEPAGE:p.271	KEY:Conductive ~ Tophet	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Anytime a tophet is affected by an effect that deals fire damage, determine how much damage the construct would have taken if it were not immune to fire. Creatures currently swallowed whole by the construct take fire damage equal to half of this amount.
Swallow Whole	SOURCEPAGE:p.271	KEY:Swallow Whole ~ Tophet	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Once swallowed by a tophet, an opponent takes no damage, but is trapped inside the creature's hollow interior. The construct's maw locks down, preventing creatures from climbing back out. A creature can attempt to hack or smash its way out as normal, but a tophet's stomach has hit points equal to one-tenth its actual hit points plus its bonus hit points for being a construct (totalling 40 hit points for most tophets). Alternatively, a swallowed creature can attempt to pick the lock on the iron hatch in the tophet's stomach by making a DC 30 Disable Device check. If a creature exits by picking the lock, the tophet closes its hatch and can swallow whole again. These locks can also be picked from the outside, but only after the tophet is slain. A Large tophet's belly can hold 1 Medium creature at a time.

#Trollhound 274
Disease	SOURCEPAGE:p.274	KEY:Disease ~ Trollhound	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A trollhound's saliva is an infectious brew of contagion. Creatures bitten by a trollhound are often afflicted with bloodfire fever, a disease characterized by deep internal pain, as if the victim's blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscular coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Trolls and trollhounds alike are immune to bloodfire fever, even though trollhounds often exhibit the pus-filled blisters that come with the disease.

#Tupilaq 275
Scrimshaw Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.275	KEY:Scrimshaw Magic ~ Tupilaq	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When a tupilaq is created, its creator can inscribe a single spell he knows (as long as that spell is no higher than 2nd level and requires no material components) into the tupilaq as a complex scrimshaw design. The tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.
Seek Target	SOURCEPAGE:p.275	KEY:Seek Target ~ Tupilaq	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A tupilaq's creator can place a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body in the tupilaq's maw as a standard action. From that point on, the tupilaq constantly knows what direction that creature is located in, and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception checks made to locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a tupilaq in this manner until its previous target is dead.
Shearing Jaws	SOURCEPAGE:p.275	KEY:Shearing Jaws ~ Tupilaq	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws capable of tearing and pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its Strength modifier to damage with a successful bite attack and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A tupilaq is treated as Large for all checks made to move a grappled opponent.

#Tzitzimitl 276
Eclipse	SOURCEPAGE:p.276	KEY:Eclipse ~ Tzitzimitl	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Anytime a tzitzimitl casts deeper darkness, any creatures in the area of darkness when it is created take 8d6 points of cold damage (DC 31 Fortitude for half). Any creature that takes damage from this effect becomes staggered as long as it remains in the area of darkness and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves that area. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Eye Beam	SOURCEPAGE:p.276	KEY:Eye Beam ~ Tzitzimitl	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a standard action, a tzitzimitl can fire a glowing beam of force from its eyes at a range of 100 feet as a ranged touch attack dealing 10d6 points of force damage and 10d6 points of electricity damage.

Doing so transforms the entire effect, such that it affects other creatures as well. A tzitzimitl can transform channeled positive energy in this way even if the positive energy would not otherwise harm it.

#Valkyrie 277

#Vodyanoi 282
Suffocating Water	SOURCEPAGE:p.282	KEY:Suffocating Water ~ Vodyanoi	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, a vodyanoi can cause the water surrounding it up to a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making it difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area other than vodyanois to breathe. A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect-vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move-it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit Dice. The slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the difference between suffocating water and any normal water that may surround it.

#Giant vulture 284
Diseased	SOURCEPAGE:p.284	KEY:Diseased ~Giant Vulture	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Due to their filthy eating habits and constant exposure to decaying flesh, giant vultures are harbingers of disease-much more so than the standard vulture. Any creature bitten by a giant vulture has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, a victim can no longer be infected by this particular giant vulture, though attacks by different giant vultures are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses. While vultures aren't immune to all diseases, they do gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against such ailments.

#Wolf-in-sheep's-clothing 285
Corpse Lure	SOURCEPAGE:p.285	KEY:Corpse Lure ~ Wolf-in-sheep's-clothing 	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:By setting a corpse atop its stump and riddling the body with small, extruded filaments, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can crudely maneuver the corpse, manipulating it like a puppet. The corpse cannot leave the stump or perform complex actions, but is instead used to lure larger prey within range of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's tentacles. The largest corpse a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can manipulate in this fashion is two size categories smaller than itself (thus Tiny creatures for a Medium wolf-insheep's- clothing). When a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses a corpse like this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond its normal racial bonus.
Implant	SOURCEPAGE:p.285	KEY:Implant ~ Wolf-in-sheep's-clothing 	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can infest a creature with its eggs in one of two ways. A creature that eats a carcass used by the monster as a corpse lure automatically becomes implanted. Alternatively, up to once per day, a wolf-insheep's- clothing can implant an egg into a helpless or pinned creature as part of a grapple action. The target can resist being implanted with a DC 19 Fortitude save, but if it fails, the seed gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its host's gut. The parasite can be cut free of the host's belly with a DC 25 Heal check, which takes 1 hour and deals 3d6 slashing damage regardless of success or failure. Remove disease (or any similar effect) also kills an implanted egg. Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing Egg: Infestation-ingestion; save Fort 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage until host reaches 0, then 3d6 damage as parasite bursts free; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Yithian 286
Amnesia	SOURCEPAGE:p.286	KEY:Amnesia ~ Yithian	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, a yithian can attempt to inflict amnesia on a target it is able to communicate telepathically with. A target can resist this attack with a DC 21 Will save. If the target fails its save, it takes a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and all skill checks, and loses all memories save for those the yithian chooses to leave intact. This effect can be cured by heal or greater restoration. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Deadly Pincers	SOURCEPAGE:p.286	KEY:Deadly Pincers ~ Yithian	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A yithian always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its pincer attacks, and deals triple damage on a critical hit. Pincers are primary attacks for yithians.
Mind Swap	SOURCEPAGE:p.286	KEY:Mind Swap ~ Yithian	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a full-round action, a yithian can trade minds with another living creature it is able to communicate telepathically with. This functions as magic jar, except the two minds trade bodies. An unwilling target can resist the mind swap with a DC 21 Will save, after which that particular yithian cannot attempt to swap minds with that creature again for 24 hours. The yithian can end the effect of this mind swap at any time and over any distance as a full-round action, instantly returning both minds to the proper bodies-if the yithian wishes, it may attempt to use its amnesia power on the other mind as a free action when it ends the mind swap in this way. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Scholar	SOURCEPAGE:p.286	KEY:Scholar ~ Yithian	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Yithians treat all knowledge skills as class skills.

#Yuki-onna 287
Chilling Touch	SOURCEPAGE:p.287	KEY:Chilling Touch ~ Yuki-onna	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A yuki-onna's touch causes 4d6 cold damage. Whenever a creature takes cold damage in this manner, it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered by the supernatural cold for 1 round. This duration stacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Fascinating Gaze	SOURCEPAGE:p.287	KEY:Fascinating Gaze ~ Yuki-onna	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Fascinated for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 20 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Snow Dependency	SOURCEPAGE:p.287	KEY:Snow Dependency ~ Yuki-onna	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A yuki-onna is staggered if she is ever in an area without snow while her snowstorm aura is suppressed or otherwise not functioning.
Snowstorm	SOURCEPAGE:p.287	KEY:Snowstorm ~ Yuki-onna	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A yuki-onna is surrounded by whirling blasts of snow, even in areas that wouldn't allow for such weather, that comprise a 200-foot-radius spread. Within this area, the snowfall and wind gusts cause a -4 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attacks. The wind itself blows in a clockwise rotation around the yuki-onna, and functions as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439). A yuki-onna is unaffected by snowstorms or blizzards of any kind. Any effect that causes these winds to drop below severe (such as control weather or control winds) cancels the snowstorm effect entirely.

Spell Sight	SOURCEPAGE:p.288	KEY:Spell Sight ~ Zoog	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A zoog's eyes radiate normal light in a 15-foot cone and increase the light level by one step for an additional 15 feet beyond that area. Any magic effect in this area glows faintly. This glow does not reveal the magic effect's school or strength. A zoog can quell or renew this light as a swift action.

#Zuvembie 289	
Corpse Call	SOURCEPAGE:p.289	KEY:Corpse Call ~ Zuvembie	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Zuvembies cannot speak, but their strange calls and whistles captivate the minds of those who hear them. Once per day, a zuvembie may call out, and all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within a 100-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or move toward the zuvembie using the most direct means possible. If this path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the zuvembie simply stands and offers no resistance to the zuvembie's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the zuvembie continues its call as a standard action each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect, and has no effect on deaf creatures. The save DC is Charisma-based.
