#Adaro 7
Adaro Default Traits	CATEGORY:Internal	
Default Traits ~ 		CATEGORY:Internal		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|

Poison (Ex)			Adaros favor a paralytic toxin secreted by the flying nettlefin pufferfish-a sticky venom that doesn't wash away in water. Nettlefin Toxin: Spear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/minute for 4 minutes; effect paralyzed for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Poison Use (Ex) Adaros are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves.
Rain Frenzy (Su) Adaros revere storms, and their lust for blood is amplified exponentially while it is raining. While fighting in the rain or during other stormy weather, adaros act as though affected by the rage spell. An adaro gains this benefit even if it is underwater, but only as long as it remains within a move action away from the water's surface (50 feet for most adaros).
Speak with Sharks (Su) An adaro can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 100 feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as "come," "defend," or "attack."

#Adherer 8
Default Traits ~ 
Adhesive (Su) A weapon that strikes an adherer becomes stuck fast to the creature's adhesive flesh unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save. A creature adjacent to the adherer can attempt to pry off a stuck weapon with a DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the adherer. The adherer's adhesive flesh gives it a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks. It can attempt to grapple a foe as a free action whenever a creature successfully hits it with a natural attack or an unarmed strike. An adherer does not gain the grappled condition when it grapples a foe, nor does it provoke attacks of opportunity when it attempts to do so. Fire can temporarily burn away an adherer's adhesive coating-whenever an adherer takes at least 10 points of fire damage, it loses its adhesive special quality for 1d4 rounds. Universal solvent, alchemical solvent, or a similar fluid removes an adherer's adhesive quality for 1 hour if it fails a DC 15 Reflex save, or for 1d4 rounds if it makes the save. The adherer's skin loses its adhesive quality 1 hour after the adherer dies. An adherer can release anything stuck to it as a free action. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

#Adlet 9
Arctic Stride (Ex) An adlet can move through any sort of difficult terrain at its normal speed while within arctic or snowy terrain. Magically altered terrain affects an adlet normally.
Frozen Breath (Su) An adlet's breath is supernaturally cold, and deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage with its bite as a result. Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, it can exhale, filling a 10-foot-radius spread around it with frigid air that deals 2d6 points of cold damage and staggers those in the area with numbing cold. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the staggered effect but not the cold damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Ahuizotl 10
Tenacious Grapple (Ex) An ahuizotl does not gain the grappled condition when it grapples a foe.
Voice Mimicry (Ex) An ahuizotl can perfectly mimic the sound of humanoid sobbing and can even attempt to mimic voices it has heard. When mimicking a voice, an ahuizotl must make a Bluff check opposed by its listener's Sense Motive check. If the listener has never heard the voice the ahuizotl is attempting to mimic, the listener takes a -8 penalty on the Sense Motive check.

#Akhlut 11
Savage Bite (Ex) An akhlut's bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
Shore Storming (Ex) An akhlut automatically transforms into an orca whenever it is fully immersed in water, losing its legs and fur. Likewise, when an akhlut emerges from the water, it automatically transforms into its wolf-orca hybrid form. If an akhlut moves from water to land (or vice versa) on the round before initiating combat, it gains a +8 bonus on its initiative check. This initial attack resolves as a charge. An akhlut has the same statistics in both forms.
Snow Vision (Ex) An akhlut can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snowy weather.
Snow Walking (Su) An akhlut can walk on snow or thin sheets of ice as though affected by water walk. It only leaves a trail on such surfaces when it wants to.

#Allip 12
Babble (Su) An allip constantly mutters to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. While a target is fascinated, the allip can approach it without breaking the effect, but an attack by the allip does end the effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip's babble for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charismabased.
Madness (Su) Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic effect makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
Touch of Insanity (Su) The touch of an allip deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (DC 15 Will negates). A successful critical hit causes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and 1 point of Wisdom drain (instead of double Wisdom damage). With each successful attack, an allip gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#Alraune 13
Calming Fragrance (Su) A supernaturally sweet perfume that calms the nerves and blunts aggression constantly surrounds an alraune to a radius of 60 feet. Any creature in this area of effect must make a DC 24 Will save at the start of its turn to avoid falling under the effects of calm emotions for 1 round. Creatures that could be attracted to the alraune's current apparent gender take a -2 penalty on this Will save, while all other creatures gain a +2 bonus on the save. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Feed (Ex) An alraune's roots can feed on a helpless or willing target. At the end of an hour of feeding, the victim takes 1d6 points of both Constitution and Intelligence drain, and the alraune heals 3d6 points of damage.

#Animal lord 14-15


#Annis hag 16


# Ant Lion, Giant 
Sand Trap (Ex) A giant ant lion can create a 60-foot-diameter, 20-foot-deep pit in any sand or soft earth surface. Creating a sand trap takes 1 hour. A DC 15 Perception check allows a creature to realize such a depression in the sand is in fact a trap. Any creature that steps into the trap slides to the center if it fails a DC 14 Reflex save-such victims take no damage, but they do fall prone. A giant ant lion can make an attack of opportunity against any creature that falls to the bottom of its sand trap. These creatures can move across sand traps at their normal speed and are immune to the trap's effects. Other creatures can navigate the trap's walls with a DC 20 Climb check.


# Harbinger Archon 18
Blades (Ex) A harbinger can extend blades from its body to strike with as primary natural attacks. These blades possess a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and are treated as both magic and good-aligned for the purposes of penetrating damage reduction.
Disassemble (Su) As a move-equivalent action, a harbinger can break apart into its components. This is treated as gaseous form, except the archon retains its full flight speed and DR, and cannot fit through gaps smaller than 1 inch in diameter. Reforming into an orrery is a standard action.
Minor Archon (Ex) Harbinger archons lack the aura of menace and teleport abilities of more powerful archons.
Wrath (Su) Once per minute, a harbinger archon can emit a blast of energy that deals 2d6 points of force damage to adjacent creatures. A DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage. The harbinger can choose to omit any target from this blast that it desires, damaging only those foes it chooses. The save DC is Charisma-based.

# Legion Archon 19
Flames of Faith (Ex) A legion archon can manifest a +1 flaming burst greatsword or +1 flaming javelin as a move-equivalent action. The legion archon's sword vanishes if it leaves its hand, and its javelin vanishes after striking or missing its target.
Second Skin (Ex) A legion archon is proficient in all forms of armor. It takes no reduction to its speed or any armor check penalties from wearing any sort of armor. Most legion archons wear full plate armor.

#Ascomoid 20
Poison (Ex) Spores-inhaled; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Spores (Ex) Once per round as a free action, an ascomoid can release a jet of deadly spores to a range of 30 feet. Upon impacting a solid surface, such as a wall or creature, the jet billows out into a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot-radius spread. This cloud lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Any creature in the cloud must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated as long as it remains in the cloud. Any creature that fails to save against this nausea is also exposed to the ascomoid's poison (see above). The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Adhukait (asura) 22
Dance of Disaster (Su) Whenever an adhukait hits with a melee attack during a full-attack action, it can move 10 feet before making its next attack. The adhukait's normal speed does not limit this movement-it can move 10 feet after any successful hit among its four attacks, as long as it has another attack to make.
Dual Mind (Su) An adhukait is a single creature with two distinct minds, so it can attempt two saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If either saving throw succeeds, the mind-affecting effect fails to affect the adhukait.

#Aghasura (asura) 23
Attraction Aura (Su) An aghasura exudes a 50-foot aura whenever it remains motionless for at least 1 round. All nonevil creatures that enter this area must make a DC 21 Will save to avoid being compelled to move toward the aghasura's location. If the aghasura moves, the effect ends for all currently affected creatures. This is a mind-affecting compulsion. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Dual Wielder (Ex) An aghasura does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls when attacking with two weapons. Infused Weapons (Su) Weapons an aghasura wields are considered to be magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, such weapons gain the ability to deliver the aghasura's poison on a successful attack.
Poison (Ex) Bite or weapon-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.

#Asurendra (asura) 24-25
Curse of False Wisdom (Su) Claw-contact; save Will DC 31; frequency 1 day; effect 1d6 Wis drain.
Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 33; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Spirit Blades (Su) As a swift action, an asurendra can call forth up to six longsword-shaped force effects that float near the asurendra until directed. The asurendra can use a standard action to direct one blade to attack a target up to a distance of 50 feet away, or use a full-attack action to cause all six blades to attack up to six different targets up to a distance of 50 feet away, each to a different location if desired. Once an asurendra directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the asurendra's turn until directed otherwise by the asurendra and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the asurendra. As a move action, the asurendra can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the asurendra's base attack bonus modified by its Wisdom modifier (+29 for most asurendras), and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the asurendra's Wisdom modifier (3d6+7 for most asurendras). Physical attacks do no affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the asurendra does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes. Likewise, any blades that are not within 50 feet of the asurendra at the end of its turn also vanish.

#Tripurasura (asura) 26
Change Shape (Su) The tripurasura has only one alternative form-when it uses change shape, it always appears as the same Small humanoid. Most take the form of gnomes or human children.
Elusive (Su) The tripurasura and items it carries are considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. A caster must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check to overcome this effect.
Poison (Ex) Tongue-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis damage; cure 1 save.

#Upasunda (asura) 27
Infused Weapons (Su) In addition to being evil and lawful, weapons an upasunda wields are considered to be magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) An upasunda takes no penalties when fighting with multiple weapons.

#Atomie 28
#Axe beak 29
Sudden Charge (Ex) When making a charge attack, an axe beak makes a single bite attack. If successful, it may also attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the axe beak cannot be tripped in return.



#Azruverda 30
Acid Spit (Ex) An azruverda can spit a stream of acid at a target within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack that deals 10d6 points of acid damage.
Vermin Master (Su) An azruverda can mentally control to up to 32 HD (twice the azruverda's racial Hit Dice) of vermin at any one time through a combination of supernatural pheromones and magical manipulation. To control a vermin, the azruverda must be able to see it, and it must be within 120 feet. Attempting to control a vermin is a standard action-the vermin can resist this attempt with a DC 25 Will save. If the vermin fails this save, the azruverda can issue a simple mental command like "fight," "come here," "go there," or "stand still" as a swift action. Though composed of thousands of individuals, vermin with the swarm subtype are vulnerable to this ability as well. An azruverda can release a creature from this control as a free action. Vermin affected by this ability act normally unless an azruverda is actively controlling it, but never attack their master azruverda. The save DC is Charisma-based.

#Baku 31
Dream Claws (Ex) A baku's claws are treated as cold iron and magic for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
Dream Eating (Su) A baku can feed upon the dreams of any single sleeping creature within 100 feet. Alternatively, the baku can feed upon the dreams of a creature that it manages to contact with its dream spell-like ability. A creature can resist this effect with a DC 22 Will save. When a baku feeds in this way, it can elect to consume only nightmares or all dreams. If it only consumes nightmares, the target creature is immune to the effects of the nightmare spell, the dream haunting ability of the night hag, and other similar attacks for that period of sleep. If the baku instead feeds on all of the creature's dreams, that creature is fatigued upon waking and does not gain any benefits it would have received from sleep, such as natural healing or the ability to regain spells after resting. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Mental Drain (Su) When a baku attacks with a claw, it can choose, as a swift action, to deal 1d4 points of Intelligence damage on that attack. A DC 22 Will save negates this ability damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.



#Bandersnatch 32-33
Bounding Charge (Ex) A bandersnatch can move through
difficult terrain when it charges.
Brutal Tail (Ex) The quills and barbs on a bandersnatch's
tail cause triple damage on a critical hit from its tail slap.
A bandersnatch adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on
attack rolls when using its tail slap.
Gaze (Su) Confused, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 29 negates. A
bandersnatch can direct its gaze attack against a single foe
as a swift action. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Lash Out (Ex) As a swift action, a bandersnatch can make a
single attack with a bite, claw, or tail slap. A bandersnatch
cannot lash out on the same round it charges.
Pain (Ex) Whenever a creature takes damage from a
bandersnatch's tail slap attack, quills, or quill defense, that
creature must make a DC 28 Reflex save or a quill lodges in
its flesh, causing the creature to become sickened until the
quill is removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 20 Heal
check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the
check exceeds the DC, one additional quill can be removed.
On a failed check, a quill is still removed, but the process
deals 1d10+6 points of damage to the victim. The save DC is
Dexterity-based.
Planar Acclimation (Ex) A bandersnatch is always considered
to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds
itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
Quill Defense (Ex) Any creature that strikes a bandersnatch
with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or natural
weapon takes 1d10 points of piercing damage from the
bandersnatch's quills and suffers from the bandersnatch's
pain attack.
Quick Recovery (Su) A debilitated bandersnatch recovers with
frightening speed. If a bandersnatch starts its turn affected
by any or all of the following conditions, these conditions
end at the end of its turn: confused, dazed, dazzled,
exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and stunned.
Furthermore, a bandersnatch affected by ability damage,
ability drain, or a mind-affecting effect that allows a save
receives a single additional save against the effect of its
choice at the original DC at the end of its turn in order to
shake off the effect.
Quills (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a bandersnatch can loose a
volley of four quills as a standard action (make an attack roll
for each spike). This attack has a range of 300 feet with no
range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each
other. Launched quills regrow in a single round, during
which the bandersnatch's defensive abilities are unaffected.
Relentless Tracker (Ex) A bandersnatch can move at up to
double its speed and still track without penalty. It gains a
+10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track
creatures it has wounded.

#Baregara 34
Devouring grapple (Ex) The mouth at the center of a
baregara's chest automatically deals 2d8+4 points
of damage per round to any creature the baregara
successfully grapples.
Monstrous Challenge (Su) As a standard action,
a baregara can make an Intimidate check to
demoralize an opponent. If this check is successful,
the baregara surges with power and gains a +4
enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution for 10
minutes. This ability is usable three times per day.
One-Armed Hold (Ex) A baregara's huge arms allow it to initiate
and maintain a grapple without the standard -4 penalty for
not having both hands free.



#Baykok 35
Devour Soul (Su) A baykok can take a standard action to
devour the soul of an adjacent dead or dying creature. A
dying creature can resist this attack with a DC 19 Fortitude
save. If it fails, the target is instantly slain. If the creature
is already dead, it does not make a saving throw, although
the body cannot be more than 1 hour dead. A creature
subjected to this attack cannot be brought back to life via
raise dead (resurrection and more powerful effects work
normally). When a baykok devours a soul in this way, it
heals 5d6+10 points of damage and becomes hasted for 4
rounds (as if affected by haste). This is a death effect. The
save DC is Charisma-based.
Dread Howl (Su) Once per day, a baykok can unleash a bloodcurdling
howl. Any living creature within a 30-foot-radius
burst becomes paralyzed with fear for 1 round unless it
resists with a DC 19 Will save. Any creature that makes this
saving throw is instead shaken for 1 round. This is a fear
effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
Infused Arrows (Su) A baykok creates
arrows of bone as it fires its bow-it need
not carry arrows as ammunition. These bone
arrows do normal damage for arrows fired from
the bow, but gain a +1 enhancement bonus on
attack and damage rolls. In addition, each arrow
deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy on
a hit. Further, the first creature struck in a round by a
baykok's arrow must make a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid
being paralyzed for 1d3 rounds. A baykok can fire normal
arrows from its bow if it wishes-such arrows, however, do
not gain the special negative energy damage or paralysis
effects. The DC is Charisma-based.

#Behemoth, Tempest 37
Gale (Su) A tempest behemoth can generate winds of up to
hurricane force as a free action, blowing in as many as three
different directions at once. The winds blow either away
from or directly toward the behemoth in a 30-foot-wide
path that extends for 1,000 feet.
Scales (Ex) A tempest behemoth can hurl up to six scales from
its wings (range increment 100 feet) as a standard action.
Thunderbolt (Su) As a
swift action once
every 1d4 rounds, a
behemoth can shoot a
bolt of lightning that deals 15d6 points of electricity
damage and 15d6 points of sonic damage, and that causes
permanent deafness in a 200-foot line (DC 34 Reflex save
halves damage and negates deafness). The save DC is
Constitution-based.

#Behemoth, Thalassic 38
Water Jet (Su) A thalassic behemoth can blast water from its
blowhole with surprising force and accuracy. This water jet
has a range of 240 feet with no range penalties. A target hit
by the water jet is subject to the behemoth's push ability
and must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude save or be stunned
for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

#Behemoth, Thunder 39
Mighty Roar (Su) Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a
thunder behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot
cone that duplicates the effect of an empowered greater
shout (Fortitude DC 30 for half damage). This is a sonic
effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Rock Spitting (Ex) A thunder behemoth can spit rocks from
the essentially inexhaustible store in its gizzard. It can
spit up to four rocks as a standard action, with a range
increment of 60 feet. A creature that is critically hit by one
of these rocks must make a DC 38 Fortitude save to resist
being stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.
Swallow Whole (Ex) A thunder behemoth has five stomachs
and can shunt a swallowed victim into any one of them
(usually choosing an empty stomach).

#Berbalang 40
Projection (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a berbalang
can enter a trance that separates the creature's spirit from
its body. This splits the berbalang's current hit points in half
between its body and its spirit. The berbalang's spirit body
gains the incorporeal subtype and special ability; otherwise,
it retains the same statistics as its physical self with the
following changes: AC 19, touch 19, flat-footed 10 (+4 Dex,
+4 deflection, +1 dodge), single incorporeal touch attack that
deals 1d4 Constitution damage on a hit as its sole attack.
This spirit projection can travel no more than
1 mile away from the berbalang's
body. Because the creature is only
partially in existence when in this
state, its body gains displacement
as the spell. When separated in
this way, the berbalang's body
is unconscious and helpless. If
the berbalang's body is injured
while in this state, the separated projection
immediately returns to its body, and the
body loses displacement. If the physical body
is slain, the spirit body immediately dies as well. If the
spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it returns to the
body immediately. A berbalang in spirit form can end the
effect at any time as a standard action, at which point the
spirit immediately returns to the body. When a berbalang's
spirit form returns to the body, add both the spirit body's hit
points and the physical body's hit points back together to
determine the creature's current hit point total.

#Bhuta 41
Blood Drain (Su) As a
standard action, a bhuta
can suck blood from an
adjacent opponent that is
taking bleed damage.
The target takes 1d6
points of Constitution
damage (Fort DC 23 for
half). The bhuta heals 5 hit
points when it drains blood.
Cold Iron Weakness (Su) A cold iron weapon is considered to
be magical when used against a bhuta. A magic cold iron
weapon always functions as a ghost touch weapon when
used against a bhuta.

#Bogeyman 42
Deepest Fear (Su) A bogeyman is cloaked in
a 30-foot aura of fear. This aura manifests
as a shifting haze of images that reflect the
viewer's deepest fears. The first time it
ends its turn within the aura, a creature must make a DC 25
Will save or become shaken for as long as it stays within the
aura. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot
be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a
fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
Striking Fear (Su) If a bogeyman confirms a critical hit or a sneak
attack with one of its claws on a target currently suffering a
fear effect, that effect automatically becomes one step more
severe (shaken creatures become frightened, frightened
creatures become panicked, and panicked creatures cower
in fear). A DC 25 Will save negates this increase. In addition,
a critical hit from the bogeyman's claw forces any target that
has successfully saved against the creature's fear aura to make
another Will save against its effects, even if 24 hours have not
yet passed. This is a fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
Terrible Rejuvenation (Su) A bogeyman gains fast healing 5 while
any creature within its deepest fear aura is suffering from a
fear effect, including any fear effect created by the aura itself.
