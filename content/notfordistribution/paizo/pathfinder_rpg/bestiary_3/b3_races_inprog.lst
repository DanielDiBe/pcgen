SPECIAL ABILITIES
Wisdom Drain (Su) A creature that takes rend
damage from a moon-beast must succeed at a DC
22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. A
moon-beast heals 5 points of damage for each point of
Wisdom it drains in this manner. If it drains a victim to
0 Wisdom, the moon-beast gains the effects of a heal spell.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Moon-beasts have no voice or eyes, yet they "see" more
than most and can project their thoughts into the very
minds of those they wish to communicate with. These
monstrosities hail not from any physical moon, but rather
from the shared satellite of all slumbering minds in the
Dimension of Dream beyond the wall of sleep. Here, the
moon-beasts raise stone cities on the oily shores of nightblack
seas found upon the dark side of the dreaming
moon, from which they launch long, dark galleys crewed
by not-quite-human slaves that sail through the void of
space down to the seas of the Dimension of Dream to seek
new slaves and stranger, more sinister wares.
Moon-beasts are slavers, first and foremost. They use
their spell-like abilities to curb rebellion or to quickly
gain minions, but much prefer using physical and mental
regimens of torment and reconditioning to break the
spirit of their captives. They often work with the denizens
of Leng, a metaphysically nearby dimension of nightmare
and madness, although as often as not these planar
neighbors serve the moon-beasts merely as slaves.
Worshipers of ageless entities from beyond the stars,
moon-beasts are often compelled to travel to the Material
Plane for strange and frightening causes, not the least
of which is gathering suitable
sacrifices for their mysterious
and demanding lords.
A moon-beast is 9
feet long and weighs
800 pounds.

Disease (Su) Purple Pox: inhaled or
injury
save Fort DC 15;
onset 1 minute;
frequency 1/day
effect
1d2 Wis and 1d2 Con
damage
cure 2 consecutive
saves. A creature that dies
of the purple pox becomes
bloated over the course
of 24 hours, after which its
body bursts open, releasing a
fully grown myceloid. Additionally, as
long as a creature takes at least 7 points of Wisdom damage
from the purple pox, it must make a DC 15 Will save each
day to avoid becoming affected by a lesser geas (no HD
limit) that compels the sickly character to seek out the
nearest myceloid colony in order to offer itself up for spore
domination. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Spore Cloud (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a myceloid
can expel a 10-foot-radius burst of spores centered on itself.
This cloud persists for 1d3 rounds. Any creature caught
in this cloud or that moves through it is exposed to the
myceloid's purple pox disease-a creature need save only
once against any one spore cloud, however, before becoming
permanently immune to that particular spore cloud's effects.
The spore cloud does not hamper vision.
Spore Domination (Sp) This spell-like ability functions
as charm monster, but functions only against creatures
currently infected with purple pox.
The walking fungi known as myceloids feed off of
decaying organic matter like many other fungi, yet
unlike typical mushrooms or molds, they take particular
pleasure in feeding from the rotting bodies of humanoids.
Myceloids claim to be able to taste things like
"innocence," "despair," and "hope" in
the ripeness of rancid meat, although
whether this is true or simply part
of the myceloids' twisted sense of
humor is unclear.
Most myceloids have deep
purple caps studded with white
lumps, and paler purple necks and bodies
of tough, leathery fungus. Their spores
grow tenaciously in living flesh,
causing a rapid spread of painful
purple lesions that, in advanced
stages of the sickness, sprout tiny
purple mushrooms
plucking
these mushrooms is painful to
the victim and causes bleeding.
This condition, known as purple
pox, is the method by which
myceloids both season their
meat and procreate.
Myceloids prefer to
capture victims alive
for later infection and
control. To a myceloid,
a living creature has three
uses-first as a slave, second
as a host from which to birth
new myceloids, and finally as
a banquet to feast upon once the
first two destinies have played out.

Hypnosis (Su) Once per day, by weaving and coiling its body
and hissing as a standard action, a lunar naga can cause
its scales to shimmer and glow with moonlike radiance. All
creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17
Will save to avoid becoming fascinated. The
lunar naga can maintain this fascination
effect as long as it concentrates
fascinated
creatures follow the still-glowing naga if it
moves as long as it maintains the
effect by concentrating. The save
DC is Charisma-based.

DC 18
frequency 1/round for 6
rounds
effect 1d3 Con and 1 Wis
cure 1 save.
Spells A lunar naga casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.
Lunar nagas are patient watchers of the night sky. They
enjoy cosmology and believe strongly in astrology,
maintaining a handful of complex zodiacs. A few lunar
nagas even bear knowledge of the unspeakable things
from the dark spaces between the stars. A lunar naga
stretches over 10 feet from its pale face to the tip of its tail,
and weighs close to 200 pounds.
Nocturnal creatures, lunar nagas often live in ruined
towers or atop mountains-
any place open to the sky
at night. There they peer through astrological devices,
closely monitoring passing celestial markers, eager to
decipher more of the universe. Those living underground
make nightly trips to the open sky when they can. Cloudy
nights make lunar nagas agitated, and a creature is more
likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark evenings.
Lunar nagas sometimes lead small cults of sky-watchers.
These followers aid the nagas in recording tome upon tome
of calculations of the stars and planets moving through
the inky black of the night sky. In small doses tempered
with water, fruit juices, and alcohol, lunar naga venom is
mildly hallucinogenic. The nagas' cultist allies often take
the substance as a ritualistic drug.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A royal naga can use this ability
to take one of five specific humanoid forms. Each
of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a
female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male
human, and so on) and the naga can
only use this ability to assume these
five forms. The naga can still use its
dual gaze in humanoid form.
Dual Gaze (Su) A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of
crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two
gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move
action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become
permanently blinded, while the other causes those that
succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude
save negates the effects of either gaze
otherwise, the effects
are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to
keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness
gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already
been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be
harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.
Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and
forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their
own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga's five faces are sharp
and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it
becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and
vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces
with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other
precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and
often weigh more than 750 pounds.
Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding
in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful
of strangers and seem to have great
difficulty speaking to other
creatures as equals.

Spells A water naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.
With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas'
serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although
doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in
common with normal snakes than most of their
kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and
lashing out at any creatures that would disturb
them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long
and weighs 250 pounds.
Where many nagas claim particular lairs
as their homes, water nagas typically have a
number of retreats, migrating from one to the
next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas
keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several
favored shelters positioned between these so they can
make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout
the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs,
water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their
sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once
such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.
As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially
well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs-
usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court
the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich
local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and
pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying
f lattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see
as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their
roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they
quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes
and often embellish the stories they've heard with their
own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such
misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The
congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the
entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with
only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures'
deadly Bite.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Crushing Blow (Ex)
When a nephilim makes
a successful critical hit with a melee
attack, the target must make a DC 22
Fortitude save or take an additional
3d6 points of nonlethal damage and
be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.
Mortal Challenge (Su) When a nephilim spends a standard
action to roar a battle challenge, all humanoids and

	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid
	s within 100 feet of the nephilim
must make a DC 18 Will save to avoid becoming frightened
for 5d6 rounds. On a successful save, the creatures only
become shaken for that time. Creatures with more HD
than the nephilim become shaken if they fail their save, and
suffer no effect if they succeed. A creature that succeeds at
the save is immune to that nephilim's mortal challenge for
24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC
is Charisma-based.
Soul of Sorrow (Ex) A nephilim gains a +2 bonus on Will saves
against fear effects and any effect that causes sorrow.
The nephilim are the offspring of demigods who bred
with humans. This joining resulted in a race of giant-sized
beings possessed of a shard of divine power and the
mortal consciousness of humans. A nephilim stands 11
feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds. Its divine heritage
grants it a lifespan of almost 600 years.
Nephilim are a nomadic, secretive race. This
isolationism has only heightened
the wild tales surrounding them,
making it even harder for other
races to trust them. While the
ancient animosity humans once
had against them has been largely
forgotten, zealots occasionally
try to mount pogroms
and crusades to wipe the
nephilim out forever. The
nephilim have proven
strikingly resistant to
these efforts.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Wild Empathy (Ex) This ability works like the druid ability of
the same name. The nixie's total includes a +8 racial bonus
on wild empathy checks.
Nixies are guardians of ponds, rivers, lakes, and
springs. They prefer dwelling in idyllic places,
which they protect from the depredations of
predators and careless humanoids. While this
often involves confusing enemies and driving
foes away, nixies are not afraid of spilling
blood to protect their homes-though they
prefer not to resort to such means unless
completely necessary. Nixies are 4 feet tall
and rarely weigh more than 45 pounds.
Nixies avoid combat if possible, using
charm person to lead humanoids away from
their lairs. They sometimes use this ability
to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task
that is simply too big for them to deal with. They cast water
breathing on charmed creatures helping with tasks below
the surface. Nixies are reclusive and prefer to keep their
presence hidden. They make lairs underwater, forming
small communities if their numbers are great enough.
Legends speak of a secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a
great lake, but no one has yet confirmed its location.
BOG NIXIES
In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to
drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets
with song or by assuming the form of an animal or
humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous
waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering
swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog
nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes,
ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as
brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out.
A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced
creature template who has the following additional
powers. A bog nixie's
	CR:is +2 higher than a normal nixie's.
Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability
of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows
the bog nixie to assume the form of any
	SIZE:S
	or Medium
aquatic animal or humanoid.
Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog
nixie can create a magical effect in
exchange for a gift or service from
a humanoid. The power of this
"wish" is no greater than what can
be done with a 3rd-level spell.

and on initiative checks.
Shears (Su) A norn's shears function as a +5 mithral keen speed
scimitar, but only for a norn.
Shift Fate (Su) As an immediate action, a norn can force any one
target within 120 feet to reroll a saving throw-this ability
must be used immediately after the saving throw is rolled,
and the target must abide by the result of this second roll.
Snip Thread (Su) As a standard action up to three times per day
but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a norn may
produce a golden thread linked to a creature's fate and then
attempt to snip it short with her shears. The target creature
must be within 120 feet and in the norn's line of sight. The
target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC
30 for half). If the target dies from this damage, the norn has
cut through the thread-in this case, the target may only be
restored to life via miracle, wish, or divine intervention. This is a
death effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.
Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful
women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation
of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch
over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon
or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted
and abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some,
the norns do little to discourage this veneration.
A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) A nuckelavee's breath weapon is a
cone of withering foulness that causes painful welts,
cramps, and bleeding, and only harms living creatures-
this damage bypasses all energy resistance and damage
reduction. Non-creature plants in the area are affected as if by
a blight spell. Any creature that fails its Reflex save against the
breath weapon must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or contract
mortasheen (see below). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Disease (Su) Mortasheen: Contact
save Fort DC 21
frequency
1/day
effect 1d4 Con and target is fatigued

disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.
The dreaded nuckelavee is a manifestation of pollution and
filth, be it the natural decay of a red tide or the intrusive
pollution of sewage and other urban waste. A nuckelavee
is a living irony-a carrier of disease and a spreader of
corruption that unleashes its wrath against other sources
that bring corruption into the world. The corruption
spread by nuckelavees only serves to further their own
sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While nuckelavees
might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims
of such pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers,
swamps, and bogs is not their primary drive, for they revel
in inf licting the very corruption they hate and enjoy little
more than watching their enemies sicken and die.
Folktales tell of talismans to carry-fetishes of seaweed
garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of
sanctified seawater-or of prayers to recite to ward
away nuckelavees or convince them
the bearer is innocent. In truth,
however, these old solutions
offer no protection from the
vile plague-bearers.
A nuckelavee is the same
size as a horse.

Cloud Form (Su) A

This strange creature has the body of a tiger, the head of a
fanged monkey, and a poisonous viper for a tail. Though
some call it a chimera and treat it as an exotic specimen
of that creature, it is a completely different breed of beast.
Intelligent enough to enjoy cruelty as well as inf licting
terror upon its prey, a nue delights in toying with its
victim before dealing the killing blow. Often, a nue will
select a target and plague it with nightmares before it
even attempts an act of violence, wearing down the victim
with dreadful dreams and phantasmagoric terrors. Once
its prey is thoroughly exhausted, the nue will finally
steal into the victim's sleeping chambers and engage in
combat, paralyzing its target with its magic and infecting
its prey with both disease and poison, letting the victim
writhe in pain before succumbing to death.
A nue's ghastly appearance in physical form is only
made eerier by its ability to turn into an inky cloud of
darkness. In this guise, a nue can hide amongst fog clouds
or shadows before emerging as the destructive horror it is.
By the time a nue crawls forth from the inscrutable black
cloud, its prey is often too fatigued from its strange night
terrors to defend itself. The dreams a nue impregnates
creatures' minds with varies from victim to victim, but
all share the trait of an ever-present, foreboding cloud
that exudes a fierce and palpable sense of malice.
Some legends suggest that nues are the spirits of children
warped into twisted forms to spread paranoia, exhaustion,
and fear among former friends and family. According to
these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror upon its
friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven
mad by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more
challenging kills to sate its vicious hunger. The greatest joy
a nue can feel is snuffing the life of a oncestrong
and proud target that has been
brought low by its debilitating attacks.
A nue is 9 feet long and
weighs 600 pounds.

Oni
Oni are a race of evil spirits, native to the Material Plane,
that manifest physical bodies based upon the shapes and
desires of humanoid mortals. In pure spirit form, an oni
is nothing but a disembodied evil longing for the sins of
the f lesh. In this form, oni are harmless and invisible. The
majority of these bodiless oni were once kami who failed
their wards, or more often, who deliberately abandoned
them. As punishment, they were stripped of their ability
to form a physical body and then cast into the void. Rarely,
a mortal creature's soul can become a disembodied
oni upon death, or in even rarer cases, after a truly evil
individual has undergone a particularly vile ritual that
ends in suicide. These oni are more often destined for
positions of great power and strength than most.
Eventually, an oni's spirit manifests a physical body
on the Material Plane. The methods by which this may
occur vary, but the process generally takes place in areas
already despoiled by sin, tragedy, or cruelty. The type
of oni a spirit transforms into is inf luenced by a wide
variety of variables, ranging from the nature of what the
oni spirit was before to the location where it is reborn
into the realm of f lesh and blood. Once an oni manifests
its physical body, that body becomes its true form for
the rest of its life-all oni are shapechangers, but this
original form is the form in which they are born and the
form they revert to upon death.
An oni's true form is always similar to that of a specific
type of humanoid, save that it is always deformed and
monstrous to look upon. Tusks, additional eyes, or
strangely colored skin are common physical attributes.
Yet while they have hideous forms, all oni are capable of
changing their shape to assume forms more pleasant to
the civilized eye. The type of shapes an oni can assume
depend upon its species, but all can transform into some
form of humanoid. Oni use this ability to infiltrate
humanoid societies, either to prey upon the weak or to
rule them in disguise.
In order to understand oni, it is important to consider
that most of these beings were once spirits tasked
with protecting a material realm they now believe is
undeserving of such care and concern-indeed, the
physical world is to be dominated and consumed. They
arrive in physical form starved for sensory experience, and
never fully sate their desire to gorge on such experiences.
Most oni seek to attain positions of leadership and power,
often in the guise of a normal humanoid, in order to
secure a never-ending supply of sensory experiences. It is
also important to understand that oni's immoderation is
also motivated by their corrupted and evil natures-that
is, no pleasure is more enjoyable than one that deprives
or wounds another.
Oni retain their hatred of the kami upon reentering
the Material Plane as physical creatures, and often their
depredations and violations of the world can be directly
tied to their efforts to destroy kami or the kami's works.
Oni tend not to congregate with others of their kind,
being most comfortable in positions of leadership over
enslaved or oppressed societies populated by humanoids
they can masquerade as. Yet, at times, particularly
powerful oni abandon this mindset and instead gather to
their side entire legions of oni drawn from all types. The
oni known collectively as the yai-oni with an affinity for
true giants-are most often responsible for such actions,
and when a yai builds such an army of oni, the humanoid
lands shake with terror.
Theoretically, as many types of oni exist as there
are types of humanoids, although in reality, certain
types of oni are much more populous than others. The
ogre mage, an oni associated with ogres, is the bestknown
and most commonly encountered type of oni,
for reasons that still send scholars of oni lore into
spiraling arguments with seemingly no end. Beyond
the oni detailed on the following pages, the atamahuta
(ettins), ja noi (hobgoblins), nogitsune (kitsune), and
wind yai (cloud giants) are relatively well known. Oni
with associations to bugbears, great cyclopes, stone
giants, trolls, troglodytes, and other races exist as well.
And above even the mighty void yai there exist the oni
demigods-entities of nearly incomprehensible power
known as the oni daimyo.
Known Oni Daimyo
Countless oni stalk the world, slaking their greed and
bloodlust to the misery of humanoids. The great leaders
among the oni, beings known as daimyo, are as numerous as
the nations of the world, and all oni seek to climb the rungs
of power to become such powerful entities. The following list
includes oni daimyo that have power in ways that make them
known and feared outside their own domains. Most of these
nefarious oni command armies or control points through
which other oni can enter the world.
Akuma, the Horned King (ogre mage)
Chimon, Hunter of Blood (ogre mage)
Guyuku, the Sea Devil (water oni)
Inma, Empress of the World (void oni)
Muronna, the Dark Mother (ogre mage)
Nataka, the Red King (fire oni)
Onmyuza, Dancer in Flesh (ogre mage)

Smoke Form (Sp) As a standard action, a fire yai can turn into
a cloud of smoke. This functions like gaseous form, except
the cloud has the properties of the smoke cloud from a
pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the effects of the smoke
cloud). The fire yai can end this ability as a standard action.
* See Ultimate Combat.
Fire yai prefer to live in luxury-an orderly and well-built
abode is essential. Even a lone fire yai prefers to build
or inhabit a fortified stone dwelling in its territory, and
surrounds itself with as many luxuries as it can acquire.
Vain, greedy, and brutal, fire yai are the most impulsive of
their kind-several tales tell of clever heroes taunting
fire yai to act rashly. They rarely let challenges pass
uncontested and react quickly to squelch any threat
to their rule.
While many fire yai seek out tribes of fire giants to
infiltrate and rule, not all follow this compulsion. Capable
of assuming the form of many types of humanoid, some
fire yai seek to subtly invade and eventually rule entire
nations of humanoids from within.
A fire yai is 16 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Icy Missile (Su) As a swift action, the ice yai can
fire a dart of ice from its third eye. This dart is a
ranged touch attack (+20 attack bonus), dealing 4d6
points of cold damage on a hit. This attack has a range
of 180 feet with no range increment.
Staggering Strikes (Ex) An ice yai can strike twice per round
with its two Slam attacks. A creature struck by
more than two of these Slam attacks in a round must make
a DC 28 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The
save DC is Strength-based.
The ice yai is a sinister creature that combines the brutality
of a frost giant with the grace and style of a skilled martial
artist. Although its magical powers are formidable, it
prefers to fight in melee using its Slam attacks, leading its
minions in merciless combat. It uses its mobility to cast
combat spells or launch shards of ice from its third eye.
An ice yai is a natural leader among frost giants, tempering
their savagery with its own wisdom. A tribe led by an ice
yai may still raid settlements of neighboring humanoids,
but the tribe soon learns the value of establishing regular
tributes and willing sacrifices-the ice yai teach that
methods that rely upon the threat of violence are often even
more effective than actual violence. Despite this strangely
enlightened philosophy, an ice yai never passes up an
opportunity to reinforce its capacity for slaughter, and will
often demand that its subjects take part in show battles, both
for the entertainment of the tribe and to nurture the ice yai's
insatiable ego and sense of dominion over its subjects.

While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and
thus often end up having associations with giants and
other enormous humanoids, not all of them are born into
physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for
cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni
who clothe themselves in human f lesh. While their true
forms remain unmistakably fiendish, with golden skin,
Claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp horns,
kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans.
As with most oni, they generally avoid their own kind,
and instead seek positions of power in human cities, often
as guard captains, guildmasters (particularly of thieves'
guilds), and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the
role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an
appropriate class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious
kuwa avoid positions of true authority, such as king or
mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper echelon of
command, but avoid positions so important that they have
too many eyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership
that doesn't allow frequent abuse of that power is a waste,
and by aiming for less publicly visible positions, the kuwa
increases its opportunities for such abuse.
Once a kuwa secures a position in a human society, the
accumulation of wealth becomes its primary motivation. A
kuwa wants to live a life of decadence and sensual pleasure,
and like any oni, it wants to propagate its own kind. Its
strength and magical powers enable it to easily dominate
normal folk, allowing it to gather groups of thuggish, likeminded
humans to lead in banditry and worse.
A typical kuwa stands about 6 feet in height and weighs
190 pounds.

Mask Symbiosis (Ex) A spirit oni can be worn as a mask
by a willing
	SIZE:S
	or
	SIZE:M
	creature. While worn in
this way, the wearer can see through the oni's eyes and
speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its
own senses and voice. The spirit oni remains a separate
creature, and must detach from its host's face (as a move
action) if it wishes to take any action of its own (including
attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit oni is
worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host's
Perception checks.
Poison (Ex) Gore-injury
save Fort DC 12
frequency 1/round
for 6 rounds
effect 1d2 Cha
cure 2 consecutive saves.
Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a
new body of humanoid f lesh, yet this is not the case for
all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to
engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result
is something relatively unusual-an oni made f lesh
directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes
the features of a humanoid as its own.
Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the
Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar.
The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster
to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking
oni mask-this does not require a Craft check or any
additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part
of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the
ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask,
which immediately transforms it into the animate, living
creature presented here.
While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it
also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a
human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered
and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They
must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest
their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them.
When a spirit oni's master dies, the spirit oni gains
free will and the ability to make its own choices-but
the spirit oni's innate cowardice and dishonor usually
prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning
to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni.
Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless
spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their
services to their superiors, in hopes that they might
someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state
to something more bef itting their egos and desires.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Animal Telepathy (Su) A giant owl can telepathically communicate
with other animals as if under the effects of speak with animals.
Insightful Senses (Su) A giant owl's senses are particularly
well honed to sensing danger or locating prey. It adds its
Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus (+3 for most giant
owls) on its initiative checks.
Piercing Stare (Su) Up to three times per day as a swift action,
a giant owl can gain the effects of true seeing (as the spell)
for 1 round.
The noble giant owl roosts in the tallest trees or in high
caves near its forest home. No mere animals, giant owls pride
themselves as intellectuals and keen judges of character.
Little passes a giant owl's notice in its home forest. What
it doesn't observe directly, it learns from its wide network
of animal informants. Giant owls view themselves more as
watchers than participants, rarely interfering in the affairs
of others barring a threat to their homes. Giant owls stand
18 feet tall and have 30-foot wingspans, yet they rarely weigh
over 600 pounds.

Though great horned owls seem large, most of their
apparent bulk comes from their particularly f luffy
feathers and rather large heads. Great horned owls have
wingspans of up to 5 feet and weigh up to 4 pounds.
Great horned owls primarily hunt at night, locating
prey through their excellent hearing. Their diet consists
of rodents supplemented by smaller birds and rabbits.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Pistols (Su) A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A pistol has
a range increment of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning
and piercing damage. At a range of up to 20 feet,
a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch
attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets
and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's
pistols supernaturally reload the instant it
fires them, allowing the undead to make
multiple attacks in a round with the weapons.
In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields
functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not
provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a
pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons
for the purposes of determining penalties from twoweapon
fighting. Further rules for pistols, and firearms in
general, can be found in Ultimate Combat.
Stranger's Luck (Su) A pale stranger gains a +3 luck bonus to
	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|
and has no chance of misfire when using firearms.
Stranger's Shot (Ex) As a full-round action, a pale stranger can
take careful aim with one of its firearms and take a single,
ruinous shot. This single shot always resolves as a touch
attack, regardless of the actual range. If the pale stranger
threatens a critical hit with this shot, it automatically
confirms the critical hit. Regardless of whether the shot is a
critical hit or not, it deals +6d6 points of damage.
Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger
and its final revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a
hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve vengeance
against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its
remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a pale
stranger first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to
finish the job-thereafter, it wanders the desolate parts
of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending
rage upon.
A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though
desiccated and obviously undead. Rare pale strangers
have the ability to hide their undead nature and appear
as they did in life using veil as a constant spell-like ability
(CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more
powerful and have class levels in gunslinger or ranger,
and often attract large groups of adoring bandits
and followers who may or may not realize that their
murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror.
A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs
130 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Infestation (Ex) Any living creature that takes damage
from a rot grub swarm becomes infested unless
it succeeds at a DC 19 Reflex save. On a failed
save, the infested creature takes 1d4 points of
Constitution damage per round as the rot grubs
burrow through and consume its flesh-this
effect continues as long as the victim remains
in the swarm and continues for 1d6 rounds after it
leaves the swarm. Any energybased
attack (including damage
from negative energy) that
deals at least 5 points of damage
to the victim automatically
destroys all of the rot
grubs infeSting it, ending
the effect prematurely.
Additionally, any effect that
removes disease
instantly ends a rot
grub infestation.
Immunity to disease
offers no defense.
The save DC is
Constitutionbased.

Gnaw (Ex) A rot grub that is grappling a foe

Rot grubs are foul,
nauseating parasites
that feed on f lesh and use
corpses as nests in which
to grow. While a rot grub can
derive nourishment from dead
f lesh, its true hunger is for the f lesh of the
living. Thankfully, rot grub swarms occur
only rarely, as they require the infested
carcass of a
	SIZE:H
	or larger creature and
many weeks to build up the numbers
necessary to constitute a swarm.
In some cases, a rot grub continues
to feed and grow, eventually reaching
enormous size as a giant rot grub.

Hexes A penanggalen witch can use one of her hexes at will
on any creature within 30 feet. Using a hex is a standard
action (unless otherwise noted) that does not provoke an
attack of opportunity. Save DCs are Intelligence-based.
Cackle Hex (Su) As a move action, the penanggalen may
cackle. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effects of
the penanggalen's evil eye or misfortune hex has the duration
of that hex extended by 1 round.
Evil Eye Hex (Su) This hex causes the target creature to take
a -2 penalty on one of the following (penanggalen's choice):
AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks.
This effect lasts for 6 rounds, or only 1 round if the target
succeeds at a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Misfortune Hex (Su) This hex causes a creature to suffer
grave misfortune for 1 round. Whenever the target makes an
ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check during
this time, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A DC 15
Will save negates this effect. A creature may only be targeted
by this hex once per day.
The hideous penanggalen is one of the most horrific
vampiric monstrosities. By day, a penanggalen appears
to be a normal humanoid, but at night or when provoked,
the creature's head rips free from the rest of her body,
coils of viscera and entrails dangling from her throat
as she launches into the air, seeking blood to sate her
unholy thirst.
Unlike most undead, the penanggalen is more akin to
the lich in that she willfully abandons both her mortality
and morality to become a hideous undead monster.
While penanggalens are traditionally female spellcasters,
any creature capable of performing the vile ritual of
transformation can become one.
Similar to a lich, a creature works toward becoming a
penanggalen. More than one such transformation ritual
exists, but all require heinous acts that symbolize the
caSting aside of kindness, benevolence, and any semblance
of feelings other than cruelty. Many of these rituals call for
the repeated consumption of blood, bile, tears, and other
f luids drawn from captured and tortured innocents.
A penanggalen keeps a vat of vinegar in her lair. When
returning from a night of feeding, a penanggalen's organs
are swollen with blood. In order to fit back into her body,
the penanggalen must soak for 1 hour in this vat of vinegar.
Once reduced, a penanggalen slides back into her body. If a
penanggalen is slain away from her body, the body rapidly
deteriorates into foul-smelling grit.
The penanggalen presented above was a witch in
life. The witch class is presented in full in the Advanced
Player's Guide.
CREATING A PENANGGALEN
"Penanggalen" is an acquired template that can be added
to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to
hereafter as the base creature). Most penanggalens were
once humanoids or 
	RACETYPE:Monstrous Humanoid
	s and nearly
every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base
creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.
CR: Same as base creature +1.
216
Illustration by Kieran Yanner
Alignment: Any evil.
Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented).
Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
Senses: A penanggalen gains Darkvision 60 ft.
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.
Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s.
All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As
undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to
determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel
resistance +4, 
	DR:5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold
10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by
the undead type. A penanggalen also gains 
	BONUS:VAR|FastHealingRate|5.
Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In
addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her
human body and exposed to direct sunlight.
Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she
retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a
penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a f ly
speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.
Melee
: A penanggalen gains a Bite attack and a Slam
attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is
standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen's
size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base
creature's special attacks. She also gains the following
additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2
the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma
modifier unless otherwise noted.
Blood Drain (Su): A penanggalen's blood drain special
attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage.
Create Spawn (Su): When a penanggalen slays a female
humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had
at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as
a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is
under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and
remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction.
A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling
no more than twice its own Hit Dice
any spawn it
creates that would exceed this limit become freewilled
undead.
Disease (Su): Any creature a penanggalen Bites
is exposed to filth fever-the save DC against this
disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease
itself.
Wither (Su): A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul
bile that blisters and weakens living f lesh. Any creature
that is damaged by a penanggalen's Slam attack must
succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4
Charisma damage.
Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an
undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score.
Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff,
Fly, Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and
Stealth checks.
Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following
special quality.
Separate (Su): During the day, a penanggalen has the
same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect
as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At
night, she can detach her head and entrails as a fullround
action. Her physical but now hollow body exists
as dead f lesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage
equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total. Before
a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her
entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to
her body, at which point any damage done to the body
immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen
herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is
destroyed can never again walk the day in living form,
but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a
safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen
wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her f ly
speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.

Flame Jump (Sp) A peri can enter any fire equal to the peri's

This ability otherwise functions as greater teleport (caster

50 pounds of objects.
Smoke Sight (Su) A peri can see through fire, fog, and smoke
without penalty.
Whirlwind Dance (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a
peri can spin in an ever-faster, whirling dance, transforming
itself into a spinning vortex of flame 10 to 40 feet high
for up to 9 rounds. This ability functions as the whirlwind
ability (DC 26 Reflex save), but any creature that comes in
contact with the whirlwind or is caught inside it takes 2d6+6
points of fire damage and is subject to the peri's burn
special attack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Peris are a race of celestials native to the good-aligned
Outer Planes, but they are also often found in the
company of mortals on the Material Plane. Believed to
be the descendants of fallen angels, peris do penance
for their ancestors' sins before they can earn a place in
paradise. As a result, peris work tirelessly to aid and
support good heroes of the mortal realms in a neverending
battle against evil.
Peris hate the evil fiends known as divs, who constantly
seek to ruin the good works of mortals. Peris often work
to repair damage wrought by the destructive divs. For
their part, the divs take great pleasure in tormenting and
persecuting peris, locking the fiery-winged celestials in
cages of cold iron and endlessly torturing them.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Magnetic Pulse (Su)
A plasma ooze is
surrounded by an
aura of magnetism
that allows it to attract
metallic objects and
creatures. At the start
of the ooze's turn as
a free action, the ooze
makes a combat maneuver
check against all metallic
creatures, all creatures wearing
metal armor, and all creatures
wielding metal weapons within
30 feet. If it beats the CMD of a
metal or armored creature with this check, that creature is
pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze and cannot move away from
the ooze for 1 round. If this causes the creature to move into
a square occupied by the plasma ooze, the ooze can attempt
to engulf that creature as a free action. If it beats the CMD of
a creature wielding a metal weapon, that weapon is disarmed
and pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze. Unattended metal
objects of size
	SIZE:L
	or smaller are automatically pulled
toward a plasma ooze. This magnetism is supernatural in
nature and affects all metal objects.
Plasma Ray (Su) As a standard action, a plasma ooze can fire
1d4 plasma rays at up to 4 separate targets within 60 feet
(no more than one ray can attack a single creature). Each ray
deals 4d6 points of electricity damage and 4d6 points of fire
damage on a hit.
Massive and devastating, plasma oozes are mysterious,
extraterrestrial beings made of superheated electromagnetic
sludge. While their origin is not fully known, it is widely
accepted that plasma oozes are not from this world.
Some scholars believe they dwell in the sun, while others
maintain they hail from the Plane of Fire. That plasma
oozes have been encountered in both of these locations
does little to help solve the debate.
A plasma ooze f lies by somehow interacting
with gravity and magnetic waves,
drifting through the air in a manner
similar to the way a jellyfish swims
in water. This creature's only real
purpose is to consume, and it prefers
to do so by drawing prey into
its fiery, electrified core.
Scholars find it curious
that while a plasma ooze
can only attract and repel
metallic substances, the thing
can only digest organic matter,
and rather slowly at that.
Survivors of plasma
ooze attacks are rare,
but such victims
describe the pain of
being struck by one's
rays as like being
pulled apart piece by
piece. Wounds left by a
plasma ooze's touch
resemble hideously
melted burn scars.
A plasma ooze is
20 feet in diameter
and weighs 6,000
pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A popobala loses its frightful
presence, popobala fever, and stench abilities
when not in its true form.
Harvester of Sorrow (Su) A popobala heals as a
result of the suffering of others. It gains

	BONUS:VAR|FastHealingRate|10 if at least one creature
within 15 feet has one or more of the following conditions:
confused, cowering, dying, exhausted, fatigued, frightened,
nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.
Horrid Haunting (Su) A popobala may use ghost sound or
ventriloquism as a free action whenever it manipulates a
creature or object with animate objects, dominate person, or
telekinesis. The ghost sound or ventriloquism originates from
the controlled object or creature.
Popobala Fever (Su) A creature wounded by a popobala's
talons becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes unless it makes
a DC 25 Fortitude save. A creature already sickened by the
fever becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds. One already
nauseated by the fever is helpless for 1d6 rounds. This is a
disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
The popobala is a much-feared shapeshifter that haunts
and hunts warm coastal lands, roaming night and day to
terrorize and spread anarchy and unrest while slaking its
insatiable twin urges for violence and prurience. Shifting
freely between bat, human, and its natural form, the
popobala is most dreaded for its mesmeric charms, but it
is more than capable of engaging in savage bloodletting
against those who anger it. Popobalas are attracted to
chaos, anarchy, and unrest, as the intensity of emotions
and uncertainty inf lames its already fierce urges. War,
changes of government, and religious or ethnic strife
or persecution-all of these excite a popobala, and if a
society remains too settled and stable, the beast is never
above fomenting unrest through its own predations.
A typical popobala is 5 feet tall with a 12 foot wingspan.
It weighs only 100 pounds.

Quills (Ex) Any creature attacking a porcupine with natural

Porcupines are omnivorous mammals that often climb
trees in search of food. The spines on
their back provide camouflage as well
as protection from natural predators-
typically other small mammals.
Though primarily nocturnal,
porcupines do occasionally
graze during the day,
eating the twigs, roots,
and stems of bushes,
coniferous trees,
and other f lora.

creature that grapples a giant porcupine takes 2d4 points of

More so than its smaller kin, the
human-sized giant porcupine is a
foul-tempered creature that is just as
content chewing on carrion as
on living creatures. Worse,
giant porcupines are
notorious in their almost
foolhardy bravery, and have
been known to attack
creatures much larger

This unexpected
aggression, when

makes the giant

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spawn Undead (Su) Any creature slain by a pukwudgie's
poisonous quills rises in 24 hours as a zombie. Undead
created by this ability are not immediately under the control
of a pukwudgie, but they receive a -4 penalty on saves
against a pukwudgie's control undead spell-like ability.
Poison (Su) Quill-injury
save Fort DC 18
frequency 1/round
for 6 rounds
effect 1d3 Con damage
cure 2 consecutive saves.
The save DC is Constitution-based.
Quills (Ex) A pukwudgie can fire two of its quills as a ranged
attack as a standard action. These quills have a range
increment of 40 feet. Any creature attacking a pukwudgie
with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons,
or an unarmed strike takes 1d3 points of piercing damage.
A creature that grapples a pukwudgie takes 2d4 points of
piercing damage. Anyone who takes damage from these
quills is also exposed to the pukwudgie's poison.
The vile pukwudgie is a small, hunchbacked humanoid
covered with long, sharp quills. These quills, like those
of a porcupine, help protect the small creature but are
also dangerous offensive weapons, for the quills hold
a deadly poison that animates those it slays as zombies.
This necromantic nature, along with their penchant for
torment and sadistic ways, makes pukwudgies evil to the
core. A pukwudgie stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs a
little more than 30 pounds.
Pukwudgies are frequently found in the company
of undead. This retinue usually
consists of zombies and skeletons
created via their poisonous quills
ability or their ability to animate
dead bodies. They have a strong
preference for animating the
bodies of dead animals over
other creatures, and often use
undead animals as mounts.
A pukwudgie usually stays away
from well-traveled areas and
humanoid settlements, but
may sometimes slip into
small villages in the night
to steal children. The little
horrors enjoy the tender
f lesh of newborn babies
immensely, and are often
willing to go through great
personal risk to secure
infantile repasts when they
are available. Their delight
in arson only further
makes them a bane of
small villages.

Rakshasa
Rakshasas are born on the Material Plane, but they are
not of it. They possess the powers and shapes of fiends,
but their fates are inexorably tied to the mortal world, and
it is there that they seek to rule. The reincarnations of
manipulators, traitors, and tyrants obsessed with earthly
pleasures, rakshasas are the embodiments of the very
nature of materialistic evil. After dying violent deaths,
these spirits are so tied to worldly decadence and selfish
concerns that they take shapes that better ref lect the
baseness of their lives and are reborn as fiends. Thus have
sages come to know these beings as the "earthbound evils."
While there are many different types of rakshasas, from
the lowly raktavarna to the powerful maharaja, the most
commonly encountered members of this race (the rakshasas
presented in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) are not known
by any other name-they are more powerful than some
members of their kind and less powerful than others, and
represent the ideal midpoint between servitor and master.
These rakshasas can be recognized by their animal heads
(those of great cats, snakes, crocodiles, apes, and birds of
prey being the most common) and backward-facing hands.
Feral traits and strangely reversed joints are a hallmark of
all types of rakshasas, in fact, features that most rakshasas
can hide through their supernatural ability to change
shapes or by means of powerful illusions.
A rakshasa cannot impregnate another of its own kind,
and so new rakshasas come into being via the coupling
of a rakshasa and a non-rakshasa or, rarely, that of two
non-rakshasas. A rakshasa born to non-rakshasa parents
generally only occurs when one or both of the parents
commits a great evil during the mother's pregnancy,
allowing the disembodied spirit of a previously slain
rakshasa to reincarnate into the world by usurping the
unborn offspring's body. Rarely, such blasphemous births
aff lict good or innocent parents, typically in cases where
the parents are exposed to great evils beyond their control.
A rakshasa grows to maturity more quickly than a human,
and often functions as a full-grown adult earlier than age
14. Despite this quick maturation, a rakshasa can live for
500 years or more before dying, at which point its spirit
seeks a new host to be reborn in, continuing the vile cycle
of fiendish reincarnation over and over again.
Rakshasas believe that each and every creature in
the universe has a proper role to play, and that success
comes from understanding one's position and working
to improve it. Rakshasas don't see castes as good or evil,
but rather as purely pragmatic. Creatures of higher caste
should be respected for their great power, and those of
lower caste should be pressed into willing service to
expand the holdings of those of higher castes as their
betters seek greater wealth and inf luence.
There are seven castes in rakshasa society (from
lowest to greatest): pagala (traitors), goshta (food), adhura
(novices), darshaka (servants), paradeshi (rakshasa-kin),
hakima (lords), and samrata (lords of lords). The rakshasa
caste system encompasses not just all of rakshasa society,
but all of life-although only rakshasas can attain the
stations of darshaka and above.
While rakshasas are forced to admit that the gods have
powers greater than their own, most rakshasas scoff at
the concept of divinity as a whole. The gods are among
the most powerful beings in existence, to be sure, but too
many examples of powerful, ambitious, or merely lucky
mortals attaining divinity exist for rakshasas to pay
religious homage to such creatures. Rakshasas see their
own transitions from mortals to otherworldly beings as
marks of their own fathomless potential and their initial
steps on the path to godhood. Thus, as a race, rakshasas
deny the worship of deities, although they welcome
alliances with the servants of such peerlessly potent
beings when it serves their purposes.
The skin of a rakshasa is remarkably resistant to
physical damage, able to ignore or greatly reduce most
weapon attacks. Holy weapons capable of piercing this
skin, however, can reach a rakshasa's vitals and do
significant damage. As a result, in lands where their kind
are well known, rakshasas take great pains to disguise
themselves with magic when they are among enemies.
Rakshasa Immortals
The rakshasa immortals are rakshasas who have ascended
beyond mortality-they are no longer bound to the cycle of
reincarnation and rebirth most rakshasas endure, and are truly
immortal. Such creatures, given the span of countless lifetimes
to perfect their art and master their cruelties, approach the
power of gods. The following list includes several (but by no
means all) rakshasa immortals known to the world. Among
them, Ravana is the greatest and most ancient.

Caera the Blood Bather
Dradjit the Godslayer

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spells A dandasuka casts arcane spells as a 2nd-level sorcerer.
Dandasukas, also known as "Biters" among rakshasas,
serve as spies and assassins. They often appear as part of
a rakshasa's retinue or secret network. Born to manipulate
and murder, they revel in their work and delight in the sight
of blood. Thus, dandasukas go about their work cheerfully,
laughing as they manipulate foes and butcher victims.
All dandasukas are restless and energetic. They crave
activity and entertainment, preferring the sick and
cruel to conventional fare. Dandasuka pranks are rarely
amusing for the victim.
Monstrous hunger gnaws at the hyperactive dandasuka's
body, making the creature crave humanoid f lesh and
blood. When such blood is spilled, a dandasuka is often
not able to contain its fiendish appetite. It might lick a
bloody blade, lap up fallen drops, or even take a Bite out of
a fallen foe at the expense of a more tactically sound option
in a fight. A dandasuka settles for other meat when it must,
but it always prefers humanoid f lesh.
Murder and mayhem are not the only duties of a
dandasuka. Stronger rakshasas dispatch dandasukas
as emissaries and servants to allies. Despite their usual
disorderly habits, they bargain good-naturedly and in good
faith, only implying dire consequences for noncompliance.
Dandasuka negotiators efficiently take care of impasses if
no favorable resolution can be reached. Similarly, dandasuka
retainers serving rakshasa allies curb their fiendish ways as
best they can, though their employers would still do well to
keep them amused and fed. One has to be careful of keeping
dandasukas too pleased, however, since they are known to
take unwanted initiative because of off-hand remarks, such
as idle wishes that a certain person were dead.
Dandasuka greed extends from amusements and food to
wealth. All dandasukas love comfort, fine clothing, and shiny
baubles. Most of them wear as much jewelry as they possibly
can without looking ridiculous, and some cross that line. A
dandasuka is 3 feet tall and weighs 55 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Extra Initiative (Su) When an encounter starts, a maharaja
rolls twice for initiative. The maharaja acts normally on
the higher of the two initiative counts each round. On
the lower initiative count, the maharaja can take a single
standard action.
Spells A maharaja casts arcane spells as an 18th-level sorcerer.
All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for
whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a
birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the
maharajas-those rakshasas whose depredations and
acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their
kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments
of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the
beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference
of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within
the rakshasa race that few can: fear.
A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa
of great power and inf luence has spent several lives as
a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's
social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends
to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with
rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young
maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth
of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The
maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a laSting
nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine
ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer
its domain, often splitting the region into large enough
chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still
have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more
than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century.
So great is a maharaja's power and inf luence and so
long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying
the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating
armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can
often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its
servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids,
or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned
outsiders-lounging in opulence.
The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent
mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree
decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with
226
Illustration by Eva Widermann
rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather
than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with
exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer
creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the
trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of
defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the
heads of failed lieutenants.
A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does
not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal
servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling
adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's
rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to
ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and
illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats.
Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control,
most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and
lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly.
RAKSHASA RAJADHIRAJAS
Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution
granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate
the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path
teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A
typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment,
and illusion. Other maharajas master various other
techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a
maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its
powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately
ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja-a king of kings.
Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas
are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower
than
	CR:21-most have additional racial Hit
Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each
additional racial Hit Die granted increases the
rakshasa's
	CR:by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer
caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that
follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A
rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time
might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per
day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees
itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use
shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of
combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like
abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa
gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells
should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells
usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level
at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as
you see fit to make a more intereSting rajadhiraja.
The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories
it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power
to manipulate life and death according to this cycle.
A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to
alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all
rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition
to their other powers.
Reincarnate (Su): Once per day as a standard action,
a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if
using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must
have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed
by a death effect. As with any effect that restores life to a
creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be
reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to
happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via
true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their
own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to
allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The
new form granted by this effect can be any form within
one size category of the dead creature's original size-the
exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja.
Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate
spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical
ability score adjustments.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Confusion (Su) A creature bitten by a marai's Bite (from
either its actual mouth or the snakes it has for hands) must
succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1
round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Energy Bolts (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action
that provokes an attack of opportunity, a marai's six snake
arms can each spit a bolt of energy to a maximum range
of 60 feet. Each bolt deals 1d8 points of damage and has
an additional effect if the target fails to resist it with a DC
19 Fortitude save, as summarized below. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
Amethyst Viper: Cold damage plus sickened for 1d4 rounds.
Crimson Viper: Fire damage plus burn (1d4, DC 19).
Emerald Viper: Acid damage plus nauseated for 1 round.
Magenta Viper: Electricity damage plus staggered for 1 round.
Turquoise Viper: Sonic damage plus stunned for 1 round.
Violet Viper: Force damage plus knocked prone.
Spells A marai casts arcane spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.
Marai are deviant spellcasters first and fiendish corruptors
second. If allowed to indulge in their desire for perverse
mystical study, most marai are content to serve as part
of another rakshasa's cabal. A solitary marai might pose
as a neophyte magician to infiltrate another spellcaster's
abode. If the marai is successful, the master soon becomes
either the servant or a corpse.
The possibility of new magical discoveries drives a
marai. Morality and compassion never constrain the
fiend's experiments. A marai prefers to torment and
exploit mortals who have no idea of the rakshasa's true
nature, and it takes great pleasure in using magical might
to bring would-be heroes,
especially those who
invade its lair, to their
knees. Such a game
offers a marai enjoyment,
however, only if subjects are unaware of the
danger or at least unable to oppose it.
A marai is 6 feet tall and weighs 160
pounds. Its serpentine arms render fine
manipulation or wielding weapons unfeasible,
and so it typically assumes humanoid form when
working on experiments that require manual dexterity. A
marai unable to do so must rely upon cantrips like
mage hand for such tasks-or perhaps
the aid of a slave or charmed ally.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) As a full-round action, a raktavarna can
take the shape of a handheld object, most often an
ornamental light, a one-handed weapon, or a piece
of treasure. If the rakshasa remains stationary
in such a form, it can attempt Stealth checks
even while being observed. It can remain
motionless in object form indefinitely, but
reverts to its true form as soon as it takes
any action.
Master's Eyes (Su) A raktavarna can
designate a single creature as its master
as a standard action. If the raktavarna
is a spellcaster's familiar, its master is
automatically that spellcaster, and the
raktavarna cannot change this. As a fullround
action, a raktavarna's master can observe
the world as if looking through the raktavarna's eyes. The
master must concentrate to maintain this link each round.
The master's visual senses are suppressed for this time, and
he uses the raktavarna's Darkvision, detect magic, and regular
eyesight to observe the world. This ability has no limit on
range, and functions even across planar boundaries. If the
raktavarna is slain while its master is using this ability, the
master is stunned for 1d4 rounds (no save).
Poison (Su) Bite-injury
save Fort DC 13
frequency 1/round
for 6 rounds
effect 1d2 Wis plus modify memory
cure 1 save.
Each time a victim takes Wisdom damage from this poison, a
modify memory effect causes the victim to forget the previous
minute's interactions with the raktavarna, as long as the
raktavarna is no longer visible or is in object form. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the
least of the rakshasas-they are born not from humanoids,
but from the souls of rakshasas who failed utterly in their
previous incarnation and who are thus reborn from a
serpent's egg.
These terrors drift through society, passing from hand
to hand as weapons or strange tokens from foreign lands,
curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and
given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas
gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world,
and what they see, their foul masters know. A raktavarna's
servitude to a master ends only when its master decrees,
or (more commonly) upon the master's death. Little
disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master,
and when they are cast adrift in this manner, they seek a
replacement as soon as they can.
A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with
the Improved Familiar feat can gain a
raktavarna rakshasa as a familiar.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Martial Artist (Su) A tataka's unarmed strikes deal 2d6 points
of damage. If a tataka gains monk levels, it uses its tataka
unarmed strike damage or its monk unarmed strike damage,
whichever is higher. Its unarmed strikes function as lawful
and evil weapons for overcoming damage reduction.
Spells A tataka casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. A tataka
can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally
available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane
spells for a tataka.
Tataka rakshasas are the least subtle and largest of their
kind. They are philosophers and fanatics, loyal servants of
the rakshasa immortals. Their familiarity with religion
and its trappings makes them excellent corruptors and
blasphemers. Such rakshasas might assault sacred sites
or rituals directly so as to foil good works and slay holy
people. A tataka holds all religions in contempt save the
worship of rakshasas, and it openly mocks and assaults
any who dare believe otherwise.
Tataka rakshasas are more than zealots, though, and
they train from an early age in martial arts-their strikes
can break bones as surely as any unarmed strike from
a monk or other practitioner of such
styles of combat.
A typical tataka is 12 feet tall and
weighs 1,300 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Swarming (Ex) Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally,
and are adept at swarming foes for their own gain and their
foes' detriment. Up to two ratfolk can share the same square at
the same time. If two ratfolk in the same square attack
the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Ratfolk are small, rodentlike humanoids
often found traveling in nomadic trading
caravans or perhaps dwelling in colonies
in slums, sewers, and other normally
undesirable urban sectors. Tinkerers
and hoarders by nature, many ratfolk
are shrewd merchants, carefully
navigating the shifting alliances
of black markets and bazaars.
They love their stockpiles of
intereSting items far more
than money, and would rather trade for more baubles to
add to their hoards than for mere coins.
Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in large
warrens with plenty of hidden crannies in which to stash
their hoards or f lee in times of danger, gravitating toward
subterranean tunnels or tightly packed tenements in
city ghettos. They feel an intense bond with their large
families and kin networks, as well as with ordinary
rodents of all sorts, living in chaotic harmony and
fighting fiercely to defend each other when threatened.
Ratfolk are generally 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. They
often wear robes to conceal their forms in cities, as they know
other humanoids find their rodent features distasteful.
RATFOLK CHARACTERS
Ratfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess
racial Hit Dice. All ratfolk have the following racial traits.
-2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence: Ratfolk are
agile and clever, yet physically weak.
Small: Ratfolk are
	SIZE:S
	and gain a +1 size bonus to their
AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on CMB
and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.
Darkvision: Ratfolk can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
Tinker: Ratfolk gain a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy),
Perception, and Use Magic Device checks.
Rodent Empathy: Ratfolk gain a +4 bonus on Handle
Animal checks made to inf luence rodents.
Swarming: See above.
Languages: Ratfolk begin play speaking Common.
Ratfolk with high intelligence can choose from any of
the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven,
Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Undercommon.
