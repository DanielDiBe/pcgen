CREATING AN ANIMAL LORD
"Animal Lord" is an inherited template that can be added to any humanoid of 10 Hit Dice or more, referred to hereafter as the base creature. The animal lord also gains the characteristics of one type of animal (of a size no larger than one step larger than the base creature's size), referred to hereafter as the base animal.
CR: Same as the base creature or the base animal (whichever is higher) +2.
Alignment: Any neutral.
Type: The base creature's type changes to outsider (native, shapechanger). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: An animal lord gains the senses of both the base creature and the base animal in both of its forms.
AC: An animal lord gains the base animal or base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is higher, in both of its forms-this bonus is increased by +2 to determine the animal lord's actual natural armor bonus.
Defensive Abilities: An animal lord gains DR 10/silver. It also gains all of the base animal's defensive abilities in both of its forms.
Speed: An animal lord's base speed is that of its base creature form or its base animal form, whichever is greater. Animal lords whose base animal has a burrow, climb, f ly, or swim speed can use that mode of movement even in humanoid form, instantly growing the necessary appendages as necessary.
Melee: An animal lord in humanoid form can instantaneously transform parts of its body to make all of the natural attacks possessed by the base animal. An animal lord typically prefers to use its natural attacks in melee combat, but often carries manufactured ranged weapons to diversify its combat options as well.
Special Attacks: An animal lord gains all of the special attacks possessed by the base animal and can employ them in both humanoid and animal form. It also gains abilities determined by its species affinity (see below).
Ability Scores: Animal lords use the higher ability score between the base creature and the base animal as their base ability scores, then increase all of these ability scores by +4.
Skills: An animal lord gains all of the base animal's racial modifiers to skill checks.
Special Qualities: An animal lord gains the following special qualities.
Change Shape (Su): An animal lord has two forms-a humanoid and an animal form. When an animal lord in humanoid form uses the base animal's defensive abilities, movement types, attacks, and other features, the animal lord's body instantaneously changes as appropriate to allow the use of that ability, growing wings or claws or fangs as necessary. The animal lord can use this ability to take the shape of the base animal (as shapechange) as a move action.
Dominion (Su): In both forms, an animal lord is treated as if constantly under the effects of a speak with animals spell, but this only applies to creatures of the animal lord's species affinity (see below). In addition, an animal lord can cast charm animal on any animal of its affinity as a spell-like ability at will (CL equals the animal lord's HD).

Camouf lage (Ex) A fey creature can use Stealth to hide
in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not
grant cover or concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on
Stealth checks. This bonus does not stack with any racial
Stealth bonus possessed by the base creature.
Change Shape (Su) A fey creature can change shape into
a single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen
of its base creature, a humanoid creature within one size
category, or an animal within one size category. In all
cases, the fey creature appears as the same individual of
its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type
of polymorph spell used should be chosen as appropriate
based on the alternate form, such as alter self for taking
humanoid form. This ability can be selected more than
once, granting an additional form each time.
Energy Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains resistance 10
to one energy type, or increases an exiSting resistance by
10. Resistance increased beyond 30 becomes immunity
instead. This ability can be selected more than once.
Evasion (Ex) A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue
ability of the same name.
Long Step (Su) A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet
per Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once
every 1d4 rounds.
Spell Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 +
its CR. This does not stack with any exiSting SR possessed
by the base creature.
Trackless Step (Ex) A fey creature does not leave a trail in
natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose
to leave a trail, if it so desires.
Vanish (Su) As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for
1 round as if affected by invisibility. It can use this ability for
1 round per day per Hit Die.
Woodland Stride (Ex) A fey
creature can move through
any sort of undergrowth
(such as natural thorns,
briars, overgrown areas, and
similar terrain) at its normal
speed and without taking damage
or suffering any other impairment.
Thorns, briars, and overgrown
areas that have been magically
manipulated to impede
motion still affect it.
Optionally, this ability may
function in a different type
of terrain, to allow the fey
creature to move through,
swamps, rocky areas, ice,
and so forth. Whatever
the choice, this ability
only functions in one
type of terrain. This ability can be selected more than
once, for a different terrain each time.
Spell-Like Abilities: A fey creature with an Intelligence
or Wisdom score of 8 or more has a cumulative number
of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice. Unless
otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster
level equals the creature's HD (or the caster level of the
base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).
HD Abilities
1-2 Dancing lights 3/day, faerie fire
3-4 Entangle, glitterdust
5-6 Deep slumber
7-8 Major image
9-10 Confusion
11-12 Feeblemind
13-14 Mislead
15-16 Project image
17-18 Irresistible dance

Abilities: A fey creature gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity
and a +2 bonus to Intelligence and Charisma. A fey
creature receives a -2 penalty to Strength. Fey creatures
derived from creatures without an Intelligence score gain
an Intelligence of 3.
Skills: A fey creature with racial Hit Dice has skill
points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence
modifier. It gains Acrobatics, Bluff, Fly, and Stealth
as class skills.
Languages: Fey creatures speak Sylvan as well
as any 	AUTO:LANG|spoken by the base creature.
