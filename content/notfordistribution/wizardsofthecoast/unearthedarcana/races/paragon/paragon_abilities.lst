Illusion Aptitude			KEY:Illusion Aptitude ~ Gnome Paragon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A gnome paragon may add his class level to his caster level to determine the effects of any illusion spells he casts, including those gained as innate abilities of the gnome race. This bonus stacks with the extra spellcasting levels gained from the gnome paragon's spells per day entry (see above). For example, a 2nd-level wizard/3rd-level gnome paragon's caster level is 2nd for most wizard spells but 5th for wizard spells of the illusion school (and 4th for his innate spell-like abilities dancing lights, ghost sound, and prestidigitation). A 3rd-level bard/2nd-level gnome paragon's caster level is 5th for most bard spells but 7th for bard spells of the illusion school. This increased caster level affects only spells that the character can cast; it does not give him access to higher-level spells or more spells per day.

For example, a 2nd-level sorcerer/3rd-level half-dragon paragon's caster level is 5th for the spells she can cast as a sorcerer.

He gains the ability to fly into a screaming blood frenzy once per day (or one additional time per day, if he already has a rage ability). The effect of this ability is identical with the effect of a barbarian's rage (see page 25 of the Player's Handbook). If a half-orc paragon has improved rage abilities (such as the barbarian class features greater rage, indomitable will, tireless rage, or mighty rage), those improvements apply to the rage ability granted by the half-orc paragon class as well.
