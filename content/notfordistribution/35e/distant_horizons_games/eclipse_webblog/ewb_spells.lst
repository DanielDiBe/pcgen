Heavenly Wild Puppet Technique	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=6					COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:One Full Minute	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You			DURATION:48 Hours or until triggered		SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No		DESC:Heavenly Wild Puppet Technique takes some time to invoke, but then remains latent until it's triggered by the caster taking lethal damage or being otherwise incapacitated - or the spell duration expires. Once triggered it allows the user to continue functioning despite the problem for (Con Mod + 6 Rounds). Sadly, unless the problem is corrected, or some other effect intervenes, the user will go down once the spell duration expires unless the spell is recast before then.
Walking The Dragon Lines		SCHOOL:Conjuration	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6			COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [1 round/level]	SAVEINFO:None (Harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Walking The Dragon Lines allows the user to teleport up to 30 feet (on or off initiative) twice per turn for up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds [1 round/level]. If this ability is evoked to evade a personally directed attack this results in a 75%% miss chance. If evoked in aid of a Reflex Save it completely negates the effects on a successful save and halves them otherwise. While such an evasion must be invoked before the damage or effect of the attack is announced it can be employed after the attack roll is made.
Catsfoot					SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Druid=5					COMPS:V, S, MF (Cat Fur)	CASTTIME:1 Standard Action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You			DURATION:One Full Day					SAVEINFO:Will Negates		SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Catsfoot replaces the user's current racial ability modifiers, if any, with those appropriate to a powerful feline - Str +2, Dex +6, Con +2, Wis +2, and Cha +2. He or she also gains low-light vision, +30' ground movement, a +4 bonus to Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks, d6 natural weapons, and the ability to subtract up to [Dexterity]d6 from any falling damage he or she takes with a successful DC 15 Reflex save.
The Lesser Seal Of Solomon		SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=5	COMPS:S				CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched	DURATION:One Full Day					SAVEINFO:Will Negates		SPELLRES:No		DESC:The Lesser Seal Of Solomon stabilizes personal spells and talents. Any spells or talents which are active when the Seal is invoked, or which are cast on the target simultaneously, cannot be dispelled for the duration of the Seal.
Drawing Down The Light			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=6				COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:One Minute		RANGE:60 Feet	TARGETAREA:One Creature		DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Will Negates		SPELLRES:No		DESC:Drawing Down The Light infuses the target creature with positive energy, granting it two positive levels (each positive level provides +1 BAB, +1 to Saves, +1 to AC, and 6 CP/a Feat chosen by the recipient). Sadly, the effect does fade [although it can be renewed] the caster - who must be able to channel positive energy - makes a normal turning damage (intensity) roll to determine the number of hours the effect lasts (an average roll may be assumed if desired). If the recipient is level-drained it will remove the appropriate number of positive levels, although this will buffer the user against the level-draining effect.
