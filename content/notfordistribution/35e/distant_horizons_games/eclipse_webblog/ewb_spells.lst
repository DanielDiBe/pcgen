Heavenly Wild Puppet Technique	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=6					COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:One Full Minute	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You			DURATION:48 Hours or until triggered		SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:No		DESC:Heavenly Wild Puppet Technique takes some time to invoke, but then remains latent until it's triggered by the caster taking lethal damage or being otherwise incapacitated - or the spell duration expires. Once triggered it allows the user to continue functioning despite the problem for (Con Mod + 6 Rounds). Sadly, unless the problem is corrected, or some other effect intervenes, the user will go down once the spell duration expires unless the spell is recast before then.
Walking The Dragon Lines		SCHOOL:Conjuration	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6			COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [1 round/level]	SAVEINFO:None (Harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Walking The Dragon Lines allows the user to teleport up to 30 feet (on or off initiative) twice per turn for up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds [1 round/level]. If this ability is evoked to evade a personally directed attack this results in a 75%% miss chance. If evoked in aid of a Reflex Save it completely negates the effects on a successful save and halves them otherwise. While such an evasion must be invoked before the damage or effect of the attack is announced it can be employed after the attack roll is made.
Catsfoot					SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Druid=5					COMPS:V, S, MF (Cat Fur)	CASTTIME:1 Standard Action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You			DURATION:One Full Day					SAVEINFO:Will Negates		SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Catsfoot replaces the user's current racial ability modifiers, if any, with those appropriate to a powerful feline - Str +2, Dex +6, Con +2, Wis +2, and Cha +2. He or she also gains low-light vision, +30' ground movement, a +4 bonus to Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks, d6 natural weapons, and the ability to subtract up to [Dexterity]d6 from any falling damage he or she takes with a successful DC 15 Reflex save.
The Lesser Seal Of Solomon		SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=5	COMPS:S				CASTTIME:One Standard Action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched	DURATION:One Full Day					SAVEINFO:Will Negates		SPELLRES:No		DESC:The Lesser Seal Of Solomon stabilizes personal spells and talents. Any spells or talents which are active when the Seal is invoked, or which are cast on the target simultaneously, cannot be dispelled for the duration of the Seal.
Drawing Down The Light			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=6				COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:One Minute		RANGE:60 Feet	TARGETAREA:One Creature		DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Will Negates		SPELLRES:No		DESC:Drawing Down The Light infuses the target creature with positive energy, granting it two positive levels (each positive level provides +1 BAB, +1 to Saves, +1 to AC, and 6 CP/a Feat chosen by the recipient). Sadly, the effect does fade [although it can be renewed] the caster - who must be able to channel positive energy - makes a normal turning damage (intensity) roll to determine the number of hours the effect lasts (an average roll may be assumed if desired). If the recipient is level-drained it will remove the appropriate number of positive levels, although this will buffer the user against the level-draining effect.

Earthward			SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Neutral	CLASSES:ALL=3	PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - Spell Access for Paths of Power	COMPS:V, F	CASTTIME:Special	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:Earthward diverts a portion of the effects of an incoming attack into the surrounding environment. It can be invoked as a free action during any creatures turn just after the damage, and any other effects, of an attack have been determined. When invoked it will negate either up to 3d8+(min(CASTERLEVEL,15)) [+1/Level, 15 Max] points of damage or any one special effect resulting from that attack, such as poison, energy drain, or paralysis. The effect relies on an innate attunement to the energies of the natural world however, hence it cannot be used in devices, or by non-neutral or undead casters.

The Mystic Touch				SCHOOL:Illusion		CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=0		PREMULT:1,[PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - The Practical Enchanter Spell Access],[PRETEMPLATE:1,Professor Darian]	COMPS:S	CASTTIME:One swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:Special									DURATION:Special						SAVEINFO:None (Harmless)	SPELLRES:No			DESC:The Mystic Touch changes how a skill appears to operate; a character with this spell might take out his lockpicks and work on a lock - or he might pull out a piece of chalk, sketch a symbol around the keyhole, and make a few mystic passes, or he might, perhaps, utter a "Word of Power". Regardless of the special effects, the only actual effect is that the user may make his or her skill check at a range of a foot or so, rather than actually touching the item in question. That's occasionally quite helpful when the item you want to manipulate is electrified, or hot, or covered with contact poison, or some such.
Manifestation of Ilium			SCHOOL:Illusion		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1			PREMULT:1,[PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - The Practical Enchanter Spell Access],[PRETEMPLATE:1,Professor Darian]	COMPS:S	CASTTIME:One standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Special, most often a five-foot radius maximum.			DURATION:Maximum of ten minutes per level (D).	SAVEINFO:Special			SPELLRES:Special		DESC:Manifestation of Ilium produces zero-level manipulations of light and sound. It can duplicate cantrips such as Dancing Lights, Flare, Ghost Sound, Light, and Message, or produce original effects of similar levels of power. For example, it can create a concealing shadow or a ten-by-ten section of illusory wall, disguise a face, cause the users eyes to glow brilliantly or to seem to have tiny skulls for pupils, make a voice deep and booming, imitate a megaphone, create a glowing aura about a single creature (like Faerie Fire), zap something with a "laser" (fire damage) or sonic bolt for 1d4 damage with a ranged touch attack, or create an intimidating barrier of (illusory) flames. Instantaneous effects are over and done with immediately, ongoing effects may persist for up to ten minutes per level of the caster. Saving throws usually apply when the effects directly involve an unwilling creature UNLESS a ranged attack roll is required.
Dexterous Fingers				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Bard,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=1	PREMULT:1,[PRETEMPLATE:1,01 - The Practical Enchanter Spell Access],[PRETEMPLATE:1,Professor Darian]	COMPS:S	CASTTIME:One swift action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched.								DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None			SPELLRES:Yes (Harmless)	DESC:Dexterous Fingers reduces the time required to use a skill by three rounds. If this reduces it to zero time or "less", it becomes a free action, although only one such action is permitted per round. If Dexterous Fingers is used on a continuous basis, it can reduce the time required for the long-term use of a skill by 75%%.	DESC:Iruks Chant of Lesser Dispelling. This spell adheres to the Dispel template from The Practical Enchanter, with the options of Close Range (+1 spell level) and Arcanum Minimus/Life Energy (the user must make a Fortitude check at DC 11 to avoid becoming Fatigued when casting it). It targets a single magical effect.
