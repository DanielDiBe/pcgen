#Languages: The major languages of Atheria include 
Illerian (a somewhat lilting language spoken in Dernmarik and the Iretanpeninsula. Most of the best current poetry and music is in Illerian. For conveniences sake, Illerian names can be drawn from
Gaelic and Celtic sources. Illerian is fairly young compared to most of the other major languages and is written using the
Imperial alphabet), 
Havril (the rigid, formal, and somewhat harsh tongue of the Alarian Imperium has been nearly unchanged
for thousands of years. For convenience's sake, Imperial names can be drawn from classical Latin and Greek. Legal documents
and engineering manuals are usually written in Havril, using its simple phonetic alphabet), Varalung (a complex tonal language
spoken in HuSung in numerous dialects and in High, Middle, and Low forms - which is a headache for visitors. For conveniences
sake - and because the cultures are in some ways similar - names for characters from HuSung can be drawn from Chinese and
Japanese sources. While it's little-known in the west, HuSung has a rich novelistic tradition and a substantial printing industry
despite the large number of characters needed to record its several-hundred basic sounds), Ikunn (spoken throughout the
Barbarian Lands, as well as - oddly enough - in Mri. For convenience's sake, names for these regions may be drawn from Old
English sources. Ikunn supports a tradition of sagas and heroic tales in the Barbarian Lands, but the people of Mri forbid all nonreligious
writing. Ikunn is something of a puzzle to read, since its runic written form has no vowels), Dravisan, Ortic, and Laran
(spoken in Chelm. Given the wide variety of small tribes in Chelm, and their fierce independence, virtually any obscure tribal
source will do for names from the area. Many ancient magical documents are written in the complex symbolic glyphs of these
languages, apparently in the belief that it would serve as a code to protect them against misuse), and Chordath (the old tongue
of the Iretan peninsula and Dernmark area, mostly suppressed during the last Imperial occupation of the area. Unsurprisingly,
it was written with a minor variant on the standard Imperial alphabet).
Minor languages include Mordan (a tongue found in a few ancient documents and druidical spells, apparently imported from
another dimension. Surprisingly enough, quite a few nature spirits are familiar with Mordan), Takkon (the most common demontongue,
if somewhat unpronounceable by mortals. Fortunately it also has alternate gestural components. It's commonly studied
by summoners), Baassinn (a language cobbled together to communicate with the Vorinax; the insect-like inhabitants of one of
the nearby realms. They're formidable, if less then overwhelming - but are favored by summoners thanks to their specialized
caste-talents, the ease with which they can be contacted, their extreme reliability, and the fact that - while they are nearly
impossible to control directly - their services can simply be purchased. The tongue has no written form; all record-keeping
Baassinn have eidetic memories. The "true" Baassinn tongue uses hypersonic vibrations and chemical cues as well as words),
Draconic (the near-legendary tongue of the lesser Dragons. Most Dragons reportedly insisted that no one else could speak it
without an awful accent and mangling the pronunciation. It's written form is highly ornamental, as the coloring of its complex
glyphs is as important as their shape), Honodath (at least in legend, Honodath is the ancestral form of Havril, and possibly of
many of the other languages of Atheria. These days its only of interest to scholars), and Yeth (a droning language demanding
excellent breath control, Yeth is said to be spoken by some of the more dangerous creatures of the glaciers and icefields. Oddly,
those who become fluent in Yeth tend to suffer from hot and cold flashes, icy breath, and very peculiar dreams).
