Negative Energy Touch			KEY:Dark ~ Negative Energy Touch					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.DarkTemplateTraits.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The creature’s natural attacks do additional negative energy damage. This extra damage is equal to the creature’s Hit Dice (that is a 3HD dark creature does +3 hp negative energy damage with each attack). This touch heals undead the same amount (lessens the damage dealt, but always at least one point of damage), but has no effect on other dark creatures.
Negative Energy Dependence		KEY:Dark ~ Negative Energy Dependence				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.DarkTemplateTraits.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Dark creatures find that they can no longer live outside a 3-mile radius of the infernal cesspool for more than a day. They begin to rot almost immediately upon exiting the area. The dark creature loses hit points at the rate of 5 per hour or portion thereof and cannot heal normally. Once the cesspool is re-entered, lost hit points are regained normally (through rest) and the rotting stops and heals.
Turn Resistance				KEY:Dark ~ Turn Resistance						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.DarkTemplateTraits.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A dark creature gains strong turn resistance because it is still a living creature. See the table below for details.
Turn weakness				KEY:Dark ~ Turn weakness						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.DarkTemplateTraits.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Dark creatures are susceptible to the turning/rebuking abilities of certain classes, but they gain strong turn resistance because they are not actually undead.
Undead Traits				KEY:Dark ~ Undead Traits						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.DarkTemplateTraits.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Though not technically undead, the massive amounts of negative energy that have coursed through their bodies gives the dark creature some of the abilities of being an undead, as follows: Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). Immunity to paralysis and death effects. Not subject to ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell) can heal a dark creature. Positive energy damages dark creatures as if they were undead.
