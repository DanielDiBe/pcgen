# I don't even know if this works. the poor hashmalite is buggy due to things beyond my control at this
# point anyway, though O:)

# In fact, pretty much none of the Hashmalite's special abilities are working now.
# they did at one time, really :/
# though certainly not all at the *same* time

# no, this erases the law domain =P
# once again, it worked *at one time* ;)


# this is intended to make it so that the Hashmalim can freely choose the Law domain, however, they still can't
# a non-lawful hashmalim still is showing the Law domain as redded out, though it seems to be passing the
# premult tag???

# hmm, trouble duplicating this bug, seems to work fine in some situations
