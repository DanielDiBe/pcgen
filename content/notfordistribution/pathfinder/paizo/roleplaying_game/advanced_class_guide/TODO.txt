Swashbuckler Weapon Training: Supposed to grant Improved Critical for all light and one handed, melee piercing weapons.

Swashbuckler ability description "gains 3 but cannot go higher than 0". The 0 should be some calculated number.

Barbarian Rage Powers on page 80

Skald rage powers should be limited to only those powers that DO NOT require a standard action or rounds of rage to activate

Ability: Earth Blessing ~ Armor of Earth should have BONUS to DR, but not stack with any other DR.

Ability: Glory Blessing ~ Demoralizing Glory "ranks in Intimidate" instead of "warpriest level"? So recalculate the the DC by Intimidate skill, subtract ranks and any bonus due to ranks and recalcuate using level in place of ranks

Ability: Inspired Blade ability Inspired Blade ~ Rapier Weapon Mastery is not implemented

Feat: Weapon of the Chosen needs PRExxx to require Weapon Focus (DEITYWEAPON)

Spells have been entered, but no TEMPBONUS's have been defined for a nny of them. Also no short descriptions (!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell) have been entered.

Arcanist spell books are not right. Arcanists have spell books that define the "known spells". The then memorize 'x' number of spells, but can cast 'y' number of spells. Don't know how to code this.
