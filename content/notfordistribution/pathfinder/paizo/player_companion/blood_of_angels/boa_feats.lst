Archon Diversion		TYPE:Combat			DESC:You are able to throw yourself in front of danger to protect your friends.	BENEFIT:The penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent decreases to –1, and you can spend a move action instead of a standard action to use this ability.  Once per round while using Archon Style, when you have at least one hand free, you can divert one melee weapon attack that would have struck an adjacent ally and take the blow in your ally’s stead, using your own AC to determine whether the attack hits you. Whether or not a diverted attack actually hits you, the ally you protected can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent. You expend no action to divert the attack, but you must be aware of it and must not be flat-footed.  You must declare that you are using this feat after your opponent has declared the target of its melee attack but before it makes its attack roll.	PREMULT:2,[PREFEAT:3,Archon Style,Combat Expertise,Improved Unarmed Strike],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:4],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=4]]
Archon Justice		TYPE:Combat			DESC:Your righteous indignation knows no bounds, and foes that attack your companions soon learn the error of their foolish ways.	BENEFIT:You no longer take a penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent, and you can spend a swift action instead of a move action to use this ability.  Whenever you take damage from using Archon Diversion to divert an opponent’s attack toward yourself, any allies threatening your opponent can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent.		PREMULT:2,[PREFEAT:4,Archon Diversion,Archon Style,Combat Expertise,Improved Unarmed Strike],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:8],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=7]]
Archon Style		TYPE:Combat.Style		DESC:You have trained thoroughly to protect your allies from harm, even if it means temporarily sacrificing your own safety in the process.	BENEFIT:While using this style, as a standard action, you can actively protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you are currently adjacent to. This grants any adjacent allies a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent’s next melee attack (as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn), but causes you to take a –2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus persists even if your allies move away from you, but still only applies against attacks made by the opponent that you designated upon first using this ability.	PREMULT:2,[PREFEAT:2,Combat Expertise,Improved Unarmed Strike],[PREMULT:1,[PREATT:2],[PRECLASS:1,Monk=2]]
Banishing Critical	TYPE:Combat.Critial	DESC:With your combination of combat and spellcasting prowess, you send otherworldly monsters back to their place of origin.	BENEFIT:When you confirm a critical hit with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon, you may cast dismissal or banishment on that target as an immediate action, and the target takes a –4 penalty on its Will save to resist the spell’s effect.  You must have dismissal or banishment prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.	PREMULT:3,[PREFEAT:1,critical focus],[PRESPELL:1,dismissal,banishment],[PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=9]
Blinding Light		TYPE:General		DESC:You use your impenetrable luminescence to disorient harbingers of darkness.	BENEFIT:Whenever an enemy unsuccessfully attempts to counter or dispel your daylight spell-like ability, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier) or become blinded for 1 round as its mind is overwhelmed with celestial light. This is a supernatural mind-affecting effect.	PREMULT:3,[PREFEAT:1,Inner Light],[PRERACE:1,Aasimar],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spell-Like Ability ~ Aasimar]
Consecrate Spell		TYPE:MetaMagic		DESC:You infuse spells with heavenly power, drastically increasing their effectiveness against would-be heralds of evil.	BENEFIT:A consecrated spell is treated as a maximized spell against evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype. Against all other creatures, this feat does not modify the spell in any way (for example, a consecrated fireball acts as a normal fireball against neutral or good creatures). This feat does not stack with Maximize Spell.  A consecrated spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.	PREMULT:2,[PRERACE:1,Aasimar],[PRESPELL:1,consecrate]
Inner Light			TYPE:General		DESC:Even when your innate powers over light fail you, you and your allies prove vigilant against dark forces, fighting until the end.	BENEFIT:Whenever you cast your daylight spell-like ability, you do so as if your caster level were one higher.  Whenever an enemy successfully counters or dispels your daylight spell-like ability, you and any allies within a 20-foot radius gain darkvision 60 feet for a number of rounds equal to your character level. This is a supernatural effect.	PREMULT:2,[PRERACE:1,Aasimar],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Spell-Like Ability ~ Aasimar]
Revered Guidance		TYPE:General		DESC:You were selected by your celestial ancestor to be a guide for a chosen people, and serve as a beacon of hope in times of despair.	BENEFIT:Select one of the following creature subtypes: dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, human, or orc. You gain a +4 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks made to influence creatures of the selected subtype.	PREMULT:2,[PRERACE:1,Aasimar],[PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,TYPE.PC=1]
Sunlit Strike		TYPE:General		DESC:Your melee blows deal extra damage to creatures sensitive to light, making you adept at hunting foul monsters of the night.	BENEFIT:Whenever you successfully hit an enemy that is vulnerable to light (such as by the light blindness, light sensitivity, or sunlight powerlessness universal monster rules) with a melee weapon you’ve imbued with your Arcane Strike feat, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to the target of your attack. The struck creature must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + your character level + your Strength modifier) or become staggered for 1 round.	PREMULT:2,[PREFEAT:1,Arcane Strike],[PRESPELL:1,daylight]
Supernal Feast		TYPE:General		DESC:You sup on the blood of your ancestors to fuel your fury.	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to a good outsider that takes bleed or blood drain damage, you gain 1 temporary hit point as you bathe in the celestial being’s gore. Furthermore, as a full-round action, you can feast on the fallen body of a good outsider that has been dead no longer than 24 hours.  When you do, you regain 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die the outsider possessed at a rate of 1 hit point per minute. Temporary hit points gained from this feat last 1d4 hours.	PREMULT:2,[PRERACE:1,Aasimar],[PRESTAT:1,CON=15]
