Breath of Madness			KEY:Black Magga ~ Breath of Madness			TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialAttack.Black Magga	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Black Magga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, poisonous breath as a standard action once every minute. This cloud of black smoke fills a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area take ld6 points of Wisdom damage and become confused for ld6 rounds (a DC 27 Will save halves the Wisdom damage and negates the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This breath weapon cannot be used while underwater.
Transdimensional Tentacles	KEY:Black Magga ~ Transdimensional Tentacles	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialAttack.Black Magga	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Black Magga's tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow while she is on the Material Plane. This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a dimensional lock or similar effect. She can grapple foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull grappled foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift between them.
Warp Dimensions			KEY:Black Magga ~ Warp Dimensions			TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialAttack.Black Magga	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Black Magga's presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature that attempts to utilize a teleportation effect while within 300 feet of Black Magga must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check or the teleport effect fails. If the effect fails, the creature that attempted to create that effect must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be nauseated for ld6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
