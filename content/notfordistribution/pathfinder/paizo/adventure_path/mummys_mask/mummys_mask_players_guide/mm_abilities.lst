Blood of Pharaohs				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Blood of Pharaohs],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:Long ago, one of your ancestors ruled over the lands of Osirion. Although you are many generations removed and the line of descent is hard to prove, his or her blood still runs in your veins. Perhaps you may f ind some proof of your lineage in the tombs of Wati’s necropolis. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves. You also gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, you may choose Ancient Osiriani as one of your bonus languages.

Devotee of the Old Gods			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait.SaveBonue	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Devotee of the Old Gods],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]		DESC:Osirion has a history stretching back over 8,000 years, and the deities worshiped today in modern Osirion are not the same ones revered in Ancient Osirion’s heyday—deities with names like Anubis, Osiris, Ra, and Set, among others. Your family never lost the faith of your ancestors, however, and your devotion to one of the deities of Ancient Osirion has helped keep the memory of Osirion’s past alive—a past that still lingers on in the untouched necropolis of Wati. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion) checks, and one of those skills is always a class skill for you. In addition, your faith in the old gods of Osirion grants you a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against divine magic.

Foreign Opportunist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Foreign Opportunist],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			DESC:You’re not a native Osirian, but the opportunity to explore the tombs of Ancient Osirion—and “liberate” the treasures they hold—is too good to pass up. Whether or not you’re interested in the history of this land, you’re def initely interested in the wealth that’s lain hidden in dusty crypts for millennia—such as the tombs in the newly opened necropolis of Wati. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Appraise checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, your contacts in the antiquities markets allow you to sell relics of Ancient Osirion for 60%% of their listed price, rather than the normal 50%% value. What is considered a relic of Ancient Osirion is left to the GM’s discretion.																BONUS:SKILL|Appraise|2|TYPE=Trait												SOURCEPAGE:p.9
