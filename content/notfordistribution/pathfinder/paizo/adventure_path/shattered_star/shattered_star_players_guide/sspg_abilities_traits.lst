Alabaster Outcast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Alabaster Outcast],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			SOURCEPAGE:pg.4		DESC:
You are a member of one of
Magnimar’s wealthiest families... or rather, you used
to be. A falling-out left you disowned and disinherited.
Now you hope to get away from the city and find fortune
enough to shame your former kinsfolk—goals which led
you to the Pathfinder Society. Despite your exile, your
name still carries considerable weight in Magnimar, and
you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate
checks made within the city. Additionally, you start play
with a noble’s outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional
nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. Your
last name is probably Derexhi, Kaddren, Mindurian,
Niroden, Scarnetti, Valdemar, Vanderale, or Versade (but
may be another of your choosing; see Pathfinder Campaign
Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments).

Though you were raised as a member of
one of Magnimar’s various Sczarni gangs, you never f it
in with the rest of your settled, metropolitan brethren.
The Pathf inder Society in particular recognized your
wanderlust and potential as an agent, and on more
than one occasion you impressed or bamboozled
their agents with your street smarts and f inesse. Over
the years, you fell out of favor with the Sczarni, and
eventually left to pursue interests outside of simple
banditry, though you still remember the lessons your
criminal relations taught you. You gain a +2 trait bonus
on Bluff checks to pass hidden messages. Also, anytime
you deliver a coup de grace, you deal an additional 1d6
points of damage.

Exchange Agent				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Exchange Agent],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			SOURCEPAGE:pg.4		DESC:
Although you’re a relative newcomer
to Magnimar, you’re not some naive stranger. You’ve been
sent by the Pathfinder Society lodge in your home country
to learn more about Varisia by experiencing the frontier
firsthand. After arriving, you reported to the Magnimar
lodge and placed your expertise at the venture-captain’s
disposal. To represent your experience in distant lands,
choose a country other than Varisia as your homeland
and gain one of the languages spoken in that country as
a bonus language (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The
Inner Sea World Guide). Additionally, choose one of
the following skills: Handle Animal,
Knowledge (geography), Linguistics,
or Survival. You gain a +1 trait bonus
on checks made with this skill and it is
always a class skill for you.

As a
child in Magnimar, the city's
ancient monuments inspired you
with wonder. Your fascination with these
relics has only grown in the years since,
encouraging you to join the ranks
of the Pathfinder Society so you
can further quench your thirst for
knowledge. Though you know little about the actual
lore of the monuments, you’ve studied these colossal
works extensively, developing an in-depth knowledge
of some of the city’s most famous landmarks. You gain
a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) checks made
in Varisia due to your familiarity with its historical
remnants. This bonus increases to +2 if the check relates
to the city of Magnimar. Additionally, you gain a +2 trait
bonus on any skill check made to receive a boon from
one of Magnimar’s magically imbued monuments (see
Magnimar, City of Monuments for more details).

Nontraditional Native				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Nontraditional Native],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			SOURCEPAGE:pg.4		DESC:

If you are a Varisian, you gain a +1 trait bonus on
Knowledge (geography) checks made relating to Varisia
and gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls made during
the surprise round when you’re wielding a bladed scarf
or starknife.

bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits made using an
earth breaker or a klar.
