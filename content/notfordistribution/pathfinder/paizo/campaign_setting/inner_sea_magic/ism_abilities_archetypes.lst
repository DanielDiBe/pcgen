Many of the Dawnflower's disciples from these lands become Dawnflower dervishes, religious mystics who use a spinning dance as part of their worship. Many bards of her faith hone their skills with dance and scimitar to become dervish dancers, but some tread a similar path focused more on magic and healing than swordplay. These are the Dawnflower dervishes.

Battle Dance		KEY:Battle Dance ~ Dawnflower Dervish		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality									DESC:A Dawnflower dervish is trained in the use of the Perform skill, especially dance, to create magical effects on himself. This works like bardic performance, except that the Dawnflower dervish's performances grant double their normal bonuses, but these bonuses only affect him. He does not need to be able to see or hear his own performance. Battle dancing is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, and effects that affect bardic performance, except that battle dancing does not benefit from the Lingering Performance feat or any other ability that allows a bardic performance to grant bonuses after it has ended. The benefits of battle dancing apply only when the bard is wearing light or no armor. Like bardic performance, battle dancing cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities. Starting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires the Dawnflower dervish to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move action. Like a bard, a Dawnflower dervish's performance ends immediately if he is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round. A Dawnflower dervish cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a Dawnflower dervish can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action. When the Dawnflower dervish uses the inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics bardic performance types as battle dances, these performance types only provide benef it to the Dawnflower dervish himself. All other types of bardic performance work normally (affecting the bard and his allies, or the bard's enemies, as appropriate). This ability alters the standard bardic performance ability.														SOURCEPAGE:p.34.

Meditative Whirl		KEY:Meditative Whirl ~ Dawnflower Dervish		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.BardDirgeOfDoom		DEFINE:MeditativeWhirlTimes|1	DESC:When using battle dance, the Dawnflower dervish can enter a trance-like state where his spinning motion represents the movement of the planets around the sun, and his spirit is attuned to the healing aspects of Sarenrae. By spending a move action focusing on his whirling, the dervish can apply the Quicken Spell feat to any cure spell he is about to cast (effectively spending a move action and swift action to cast the spell). This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time.

For example, most lands outlaw worshiping f iends. Taldor has banned the faith of Sarenrae from being openly worshiped. Rahadoum flat-out forbids all religions within its borders. But as time has shown again and again, mere laws are poor deterrents to the worship of dedicated members of such faiths, whether the zealous wish to subvert authority, free the spirits of the oppressed, or merely enjoy the right to practice their beliefs. Clerics in these circumstances must conceal their true natures, practice their magic in secret, and always be on guard for betrayal and discovery.

An eldritch scar appears as a normal scar, save that it flickers with faint radiance of a color of your choice. The next time that creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it triggers a primal magic event of a CR equal to your caster level. This causes the eldritch scar to vanish. A creature can be marked by only one eldritch scar at a time (a more powerful one replaces a weaker one). An eldritch scar fades automatically after 24 hours. It can be removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the curse’s level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event—an event triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade.

Familiar Tattoo			KEY:Familiar Tattoo ~ Tattooed Sorcerer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SorcererBloodlinePowerLvl1									DESC:A tattooed sorcerer gains a familiar as an arcane bond, as a wizard equal to her sorcerer level. Her sorcerer levels stack with any wizard or witch levels she possesses when determining the powers of her familiar--this ability does not allow her to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Unlike most familiars, her familiar can transform itself into a tattoo that she carries in her flesh. Transforming into a tattoo or back to normal familiar form is a move action for her familiar. In tattoo form, the familiar looks like a stylized version of itself, but does not count as a creature separate from the tattooed sorcerer. In tattoo form it continues to grant its special familiar ability, but otherwise has no abilities and can take no actions except to transform from tattoo into creature. A familiar tattoo cannot be erased or dispelled. This ability replaces the 1st-level bloodline power.
