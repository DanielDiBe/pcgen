Beguiling Aura (Su) Any creature sexually attracted to women runs the risk of being beguiled by a nereid if it looks upon her beauty from a distance of 30 feet or less. If the creature fails a DC 25 Will save, it is immediately fascinated. A nereid may use her suggestion spell-like ability at will against creatures that are fascinated by her beguiling aura. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A nilbog gains any extra hit points above its normal total as temporary hit points, though it can never have more than twice its normal hit points. (Excess hit points are simply lost.). The nilbog can only be damaged through the use of curative magic and effects (cure light wounds and healing potions, for instance). Curative magic deals damage equal to the amount it would normally heal.

Shillelagh (Su) Any oaken club or staff wielded by an oakman automatically gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell (caster level 5th). The oakman does not have to cast this spell to get the benefit; its effects are automatic as long as the club or staff is in the oakman's hands. (This benefit is already included in the statistics block above.) In anyone else's hands, the oaken club or staff functions as a normal weapon of whatever type it is.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Tree Dependent (Su) An oakman is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never stray more than a mile from it. An oakman who moves more than a mile from his bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. An oakman that is out of range of his bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows-eventually, this separation kills the oakman. An oakman cannot forge a new bond with a new tree; if his tree is destroyed, he will eventually sicken and die.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) An obsidian minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the obsidian minotaur's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

Possession (Su) Once per round, by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a phantasm can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it doesn't require a receptacle. If the attack succeeds, the phantasm's body vanishes into the opponent's body. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 21). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that phantasm's possession ability for one day.  A possessing phantasm automatically deals one negative level (from its energy drain ability) each round. A possessed creature can attempt a Will save (DC 19) each round to force the phantasm out of its body. If successful, the phantasm is ejected from the host and cannot attempt to possess the same host for 1 minute. If turned or subjected to a dismissal spell while possessing a host, the phantasm is likewise ejected. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

A phantom stalker never uses this ability if it would harm the one that summoned it, unless the summoner itself is to blame for the phantom stalker's destruction (i.e., if the summoner attacks the stalker or orders it into battle against opponents that clearly outmatch it).

Fear (Su) A creature hit by a thrown object (see telekinesis below) must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of the same poltergeist for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Natural Invisibility (Su) This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated, and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts, powerful spells such as dispel evil usually are effective. Short of that, however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Telekinesis (Su) A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or creature within 10 feet to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). This ability functions as the violent thrust version of the telekinesis spell (caster level 10th) with the following exceptions: the poltergeist can hurl only one object or creature per round; the poltergeist uses its Charisma modifier (usually +2) to modify its base attack bonus. A creature targeted by this ability can make a DC 13 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Unnatural Aura (Su) Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a poltergeist at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Condemn (Su) Once per day, as a melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the connection between a divine caster and his or her deity. The target can attempt a DC 22 Will save (to negate the effects. If the save fails, the divine caster loses the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke undead, smite good or evil, and loses the use of other divine-based spell, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even if the save succeeds, the divine caster touched takes 10d6 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Additionally, one that fails its save resists all beneficial divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) and effects cast on him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial divine spell on a condemned creature must make a successful DC 20 caster level check or the spell has no effect on the condemned creature.  The effects of this ability are permanent but can be removed by the casting of a remove curse spell followed by an atonement spell. The one casting the remove curse and atonement spells must be a divine caster who worships the same god as the condemned and who is of a class level equal to or higher than the condemned.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Disgorge (Ex) A blood pudding that has infused itself with a host can force the creature's blood out through its pores, eyes, ears, and mouth. This is a standard action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round.  At Constitution 0, the host dies and the blood pudding feeds on the corpse. When sated, the pudding exits, and to onlookers it appears as if the slain creature is bleeding profusely.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Infuse (Ex) A blood pudding that makes a successful grapple check can forcibly merge its form with that of a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood pudding's form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and any other opening in the host's body. This special attack deals no damage but allows the blood pudding to use its disgorge special attack (see above).  A creature infused with a blood pudding can try to forcibly eject the creature once per round as a standard action (coughing it up, vomiting, and so on). This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A creature can be affected by the pudding's infuse attack again, but gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save. This bonus lasts for one day and is effective against the infuse attack of that blood pudding only.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Racial Vulnerabilities (Ex) Drinking alcohol weakens an infused pudding and reduces the Constitution damage sustained from its disgorge attack by one-half for the next 1d4+1 rounds.  Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood pudding to eject itself from the host in the same round the vinegar is consumed. A creature drinking pure vinegar must make a successful DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A blood pudding will not use its infuse attack against that host for one day.  A blood pudding hit with a cold effect or attack is slowed for 3 rounds (as the slow spell) and loses its racial bonus to grapple checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.

Acid (Ex) A brown pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit or constriction attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (nonmetal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a brown pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a brown pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a brown pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Suction (Ex) The brown pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A brown pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a brown pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.
