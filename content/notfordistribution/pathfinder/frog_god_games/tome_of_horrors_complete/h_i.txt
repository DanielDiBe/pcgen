Drag (Ex) If the hanged man entangles a foe with his rope attack, it drags its opponent 10 feet closer as a standard action on each subsequent round that it succeeds on a CMB check (including a +5 racial bonus) without provoking attacks of opportunity. When an opponent is dragged within 5 feet, the hanged man can attack with both of its claws in the same round. It gains a +4 attack bonus against opponents entangled in its rope.

Entangle (Su) The hanged man's noose is a 20-ft. length of rope that entangles opponents of any size as an animate rope spell (CL 15th, DC 21). A hanged man can lash its rope outward 20 feet with no range penalty. The rope functions only for the hanged man it belongs to and no other. It has AC 22, hardness 10, hp 10, and DR 5/slashing. If the rope is severed, both it and the hanged man are destroyed. The save DC is Strength-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Hallucinatory Spores (Ex) As a standard action, a hangman tree can release a cloud of spores in a 50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC 19, +1 per previous save) each round. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the hallucinatory spores of that hangman's tree for 24 hours.

Vines (Ex) The vines of a hangman tree have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a hangman tree's vine does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the vine is currently grappling a target, the hangman tree takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman tree.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Alternate Form (Su) A haunt's natural form is that of a translucent image appearing much as the person did in life. As a standard action, it can alter its form so as to appear as a floating, luminescent ball of light (possibly being mistaken for a will-o'-wisp in this form). In this form, it cannot use its Dexterity damage attack or its malevolence attack. It retains its incorporeal form and can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals normal damage (but not Dex damage).  A haunt remains in one form or the other until it chooses to assume a new one (as a standard action). A change in form cannot be dispelled. A haunt cannot change forms while using its malevolence attack (that is, while possessing a host).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a haunt can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane whose Dexterity has been reduced to 0 (either through the haunt's touch or by some other means). This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the haunt's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the haunt must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 14 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same haunt's malevolence for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the haunt vanishes into the target's body (whose Dexterity temporarily returns to normal) and attempts to complete its unfinished task.  If the haunt completes its task, it leaves the host and fades away forever. When the haunt leaves the host, the host's Dexterity drops back to 0. If the host body is slain while the haunt is in possession of it, the creature becomes tied to that area and can never leave. Its unfinished task remains the same.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a haunt through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 1d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a haunt is to use dispel evil/good/law/chaos (depending on the haunt's alignment) or determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Strangle (Su) If a creature possessed by a haunt has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt on either the law/ chaos or good/evil axis, it attempts to strangle the host using its own hands (i.e., the hands of the host body). Unless precautions are taken to restrain the possessed victim's hands, they immediately reach for the throat and begin strangling the haunt-possessed body. An opponent takes 1d4 points of damage each round until its hands are forcibly restrained with a successful CMB check, the haunt is ejected from the body, or the victim dies.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerability (Ex) A haunt can be forcibly ejected from a host if hold person is cast on the victim and the haunt fails its Will save. A dispel evil/good/law/chaos spell (depending on the haunt's alignment) instantly ejects the creature from the host and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the haunt. A haunt slain in such a manner cannot rejuvenate and is permanently destroyed.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Drone (Ex) The rapid beating of the helix moth's wings creates a droning sound that is audible up to 60 feet away. This droning clouds the minds of all creatures within 30 feet that hear it except other helix moths. A successful DC 21 Will save negates the effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, a creature suffers a -4 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, checks and saves for 1 minute. After this time, a new save can be attempted (same DC) if the helix moth's droning can still be heard and the creature is within range. If this save fails, the creature remains affected for another one minute. This continues every minute until a successful save is made or the combat ends. A creature that makes a successful Will save is unaffected by the droning of that helix moth for one day. The droning is a free action so long as the helix moth is airborne. On the ground, it may beat its wings as a move action with the effects as above.

Immolation (Su) A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and the engulfed opponent (no save). (Reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth by its fire resistance.) A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours (providing it survives the immolation).  Creatures within 10 feet of the hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite. The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this ability or until the fire is extinguished. The save DC is Constitution-based.

INPHIDIANS

Somewhere in humanities lost aeons a race of malformed serpentine humanoids
rose, now known as inphidians. While the truth of their origins has been long
forgotten, most sages subscribe to one of two theories. The first states the
creatures are the failed results of horrific experiments performed by the dark
and nameless sorcerers of an ancient snakecult in their attempts to ensorcel
their followers. The second theory contends the inphidians were once a cult of
snakeworshippers cursed by an ancient snake-god for some transgression against
the ethos. Whatever the truth, it appears as of late that the inphidians
have evolved into true race, beyond the machinations of arcane experiments or
curses. While there exist several known species, recent reports describe
encounters with yet unidentified inphidians and others are sure to surface as
encounters with the race grow more frequent.

All inphidians, regardless of the subspecies, have viper heads in place of
their hands. The creatures use these in combat to deliver a powerful bite that
injects the victim with poison. Inphidians, particularly the craftsmen, wear
special gloves called inphidian gauntlets that let them use their hands like
any other humanoid with five digits (including an opposing thumb) uses its
hands. See the sidebar for details on inphidian gauntlets.

Inphidian Gauntlets
Aura faint transmutation; CL 3rd
Slot hands; Price 24,000; Weight1/2 lb.

DESCRIPTION
Inphidian gauntlets are leather or metal gauntlets that provide a creature (normally an inphidian) with limbs but without humanoid hands a set of fully functional hands. When wearing these gauntlets, the creature can manipulate items normally considered unusable (because the creature lacks hands). The wearer can use its full Strength and Dexterity while wearing these gauntlets. An inphidian cannot use its hand-snake bite attacks while wearing inphidian gauntlets. These gauntlets serve no purpose to creatures with humanoid hands.  These gauntlets are manufactured by inphidian craftsmen and are virtually unknown outside the inphidian community.
