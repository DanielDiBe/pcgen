Reanimation (Su) When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather it falls inert and begins the process of reanimating by regaining 1 hit point per round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again.  If the creature is destroyed by channeled positive energy, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle repose on the cadaver when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain hit points at half the normal rate (i.e. 1 hit point every other round).

Cocoon (Ex) Once per round as a standard action, and no more than three times per day, a cerebral stalker can cocoon a grappled foe by shooting sticky webbing from its body. The webs cover as much of the victim as possible, excluding the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The webs remain attached to the cerebral stalker's body and stretch from just under its arms to its knees. A cocooned victim is anchored to the cerebral stalker and cannot move. The cocooned creature can, as a standard action, break free with a successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check. The webbing has 8 hit points. Note the victim is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus. Once a victim is cocooned, the cerebral stalker can use its sink ability.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Consume Brain (Ex) Once it has its victim underground, the cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours. A victim slain in this manner is ejected from the ground and becomes a zombie (see below).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Sink (Su) After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist; in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both stalker and foe are completely underground.  Sinking is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Creatures attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above), and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold monster spell) for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each round to negate the paralysis. The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis). The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the surface.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Death Throes (Ex) When a chrystone is destroyed, it shatters, spraying razor-sharp fragments from its form. Creatures within 5 feet of the chrystone take 2d6 points of damage. A DC 12 Reflex saving throw halves the damage. A chrystone can prevent itself from shattering by making a DC 12 Will save as it is destroyed.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Spell-like Abilities (Sp) Three times per day, a chrystone can use its stone shape to repair itself, healing 1d6 points of damage per use. This requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The save DC for the chrystone's color spray includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A chrystone is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A transmute rock to mud spell slows a chrystone (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.  A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the chrystone's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a chrystone with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or shatter into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the chrystone takes no damage from the attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Howl (Su) The howl of a church grim causes any evil creature within its limited domain (its churchyard; see below) to make a successful DC 16 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral creatures are completely unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to steal from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Know Alignment (Su) A church grim makes automatically knows the alignment of any creature that enters its churchyard. This ability can be dispelled, but the church grim can reactivate it the following round as a free action.  It cannot extend this ability beyond the limits of its domain, however.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Limited Domain (Ex) The realm of a church grim encompasses only the churchyard it defends; it can wander freely in its cemetery and any adjoining church grounds, but it cannot move beyond; it must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Rejuvenation (Su) It is difficult to destroy a church grim through simple combat. A slain church grim restores itself within 24 hours. Even the most powerful spells are often only temporary solutions. A church grim that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its churchyard with a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's HD) against DC 16.  The only sure way to get rid of a church grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the churchyard.  Soul Defender (Su) It is the sacred duty of a church grim to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard. Any attempts to cast an animate dead or similar spell to create undead within the confines of an area guarded by a church grim requires the caster to make a successful DC 20 caster level check. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the full wrath of the church grim immediately.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) As a standard action, a giant clam can attempt to pull a creature up to one size smaller than itself that is within reach into its interior. An opponent can make an attack of opportunity against the clam, but if it does so it is not entitled to a saving throw. An opponent that does not attempt an attack of opportunity must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or be pulled into the clam's interior. An engulfed creature is subject to the clam's acid, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based. A giant clam can be forced open by making an opposed Strength check against the clam's Strength check. Otherwise, it opens on its own in 1d4 hours.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) The rough shell of a giant clam is usually draped with barnacles, anemones, and bits of coral, which help it to blend in with its environment.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Natural Invisibility (Su) As creatures of living sound, a clamor is naturally invisible, even when it attacks. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sound Mimicry (Ex) A clamor can duplicate any sound it has ever encountered with perfect accuracy as a free action. It can use this ability to duplicate speech, music, or any other auditory phenomenon, although sounds with magical properties (such as power word spells) lose their magical effects when duplicated.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sonic Burst (Ex) A clamor can emit a massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round action that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living creature within 100 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Furthermore, living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened. A restoration, wish, miracle, or remove blindness/deafness spell restores hearing and negates the stunning effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Speed of Sound (Ex): Once per day, a clamor can move at the speed of sound for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Its fly speed increases to 6,820 ft. (34,100 squares), but it cannot attack or use of any of its other abilities when moving this way.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sound-Related Vulnerabilities (Ex) Any magical silence effect or effect that creates a vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.  Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism, whispering wind: These magically generated or altered sounds force a clamor to make a Will save (DC 10 + spell level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level.  Sculpt sound: If targeted directly at the clamor, this spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude save for half damage. Alternately, a bard (and only a bard) using sculpt sound can attempt to completely control the actions of a clamor. The clamor is allowed an initial Fortitude save to negate the effect; if it fails, it is controlled as if by a dominate monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the bard's class level.  Shout, sound burst: These spells do no damage to a clamor, but force it to make a Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the caster.

-----------------------------------------------

CLOCKWORKS
DESC:Clockworks are the creations of powerful machines called brain gears. 

Each clockwork creature varies from its brethren and each is assigned a task by the brain gear that created it. Clockworks are automatons and follow orders without question. It is through these various clockwork creations that brain gears seek to destroy all living creatures.

The clockwork creations controlled by a brain gear share several characteristics as detailed in the statistics block and text below. Most constructs are immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or fewer.  Clockworks with the self-repair special quality, however, are not destroyed at 0 or less hit points. While they do cease to function, they continue to self-repair, only at a slower rate.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Self-Repair (Ex) Some clockworks can  automatically repair themselves with spare parts and scrap, and a built-in mechanism allows them to self-repair even when seemingly destroyed. The clockwork automatically heals damage at a fixed rate per round, as given in the clockwork's entry. Certain attack forms, typically acid, cold, and fire cannot be self-repaired. The clockwork's descriptive text describes the details.  A clockwork with self-repair can repair lost limbs (including its head), but it takes 3d6 minutes to do so. A clockwork reduced to 0 or less hit points is not destroyed, but begins to self-repair damage at one-half its normal rate (minimum 1 hit point per round). It still cannot repair damage dealt by acid, cold, or fire effects.  For example, a clockwork with self-repair 3 normally regains 3 hit points per round. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round until it has at least 1 hit point. Once it has self-repaired itself to at least 1 hit point, the clockwork begins functioning normally again.

Construction
The secrets of clockwork construction are known only to the brain gear and to those it employs.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Control Clockwork (Su) Any clockwork that comes within two miles of a brain gear immediately falls under that brain gear's control. If more than one brain gear attempts to control a clockwork (or if the clockwork is under the control of another brain gear or overseer), each gear must make an opposed Intelligence check; the winner gains control of that clockwork. When a clockwork moves more than 2 miles away from a brain gear, it continues to perform the last order given to it, but there is a 25% percent chance each hour that it ceases to function, collapsing into a pile of junk. If a brain gear later moves within two miles of the destroyed clockwork, the clockwork can reactivate if it has the self-repair ability. Otherwise, it remains destroyed. A brain gear in control of at least one clockwork can, as a free action once per round, use that clockwork to perceive the world through its senses (such as seeing the area surrounding the clockwork). This ability has a range of 2 miles. If a brain gear controls multiple clockworks, it can instantaneously jump from clockwork to clockwork, keeping tabs on all of its thralls and perceiving the world through their senses. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once per round as a free action. A brain gear uses this ability to give commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to fight with highly coordinated tactics. Each clockwork is capable of receiving roughly 100 words worth of orders. Anything beyond that is too complicated for the clockwork to handle.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Dream (Su) The brain gear has a limited ability to send psychic messages. Once per week, it can create an effect similar to a dream spell (caster level 10th). The brain gear can contact multiple creatures by designating a generic creature type, such as ogre or human. This designation affects every member of the target type within a 2-mile radius of the brain gear.

Independent Clockwork (Su) An overseer can move beyond the brain gear's normal area of influence while maintaining contact with it. Normally, a brain gear can control only clockworks that are within two miles of its position. A brain gear can control an overseer that stays within 10 miles of its position. In addition, the overseer can act as a field commander for up to 20 HD worth of clockworks that are within 100 feet of its position.

Control Host (Su) By burrowing into the base of a corpse's skull and attaching itself with its pincers, a parasite clockwork can animate the creature (similar to an animate dead spell). The animated creature uses its own HD, base attack, saves, and hit points. It has an effective Wisdom of 10 and Charisma of 1. It does not have an Intelligence score. The host loses all skills, feats, class abilities, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities (including the ability to cast spells) it possessed in life. It retains its AC and any natural attacks it possessed, including proficiency with weapons. A host retains any proficiency with armor and shields it possessed while alive.  Spells such as detect undead or detect magic do not reveal the presence of the parasite or host. So long as the parasite clockwork remains in contact with the host, the control remains in effect.  A host brought to 0 or less hit points is destroyed, but can be repaired by the clockwork parasite using its self-repair ability (though this only works if the host is brought to 0 or less hit points; a host does not gain the self-repair ability of the parasite while "alive").

Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a jade colossus can spray a blast of green energy in either a 60-foot cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the affected area takes 15d6 points of damage, Reflex half DC 26. A creature slain as the result of this breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is Constitution-based. A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or miracle. The victim remains dead, but can then be raised or resurrected normally.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A jade colossus is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A disintegrate spell slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.  A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus gets no saving throw against fire effects.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Light Reflection (Ex) The angles and makeup of the jade colossus allows it to reflect any light-based attacks or effects (it cannot reflect natural sunlight however). Reflected light acts as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that blinds all creatures within 40 feet. A creature can attempt a Reflex save DC 26 to avoid being blinded. If the save fails, the creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds (as the blindness spell); creatures that successfully save are instead dazzled for a like amount of time. Undead and similar creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points of damage (a successful Reflex save DC 26 halves the damage).



Ruby Star of Law

Sages speak of a jade colossus located in the City of Brass that has the ruby star of law (a gem of inestimable value) embedded in its forehead. The Jade Guardian (as it is known in the City) is a CR 18 advanced jade colossus with the following additional ability. 	

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Energy Ray (Su): Once per round as a swift action, the Jade Guardian can fire a ray to a range of 200 feet (requires a successful ranged touch attack to hit). Genies hit by this ray must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 26) or take 6d4 points of Constitution damage. On a successful save, the genie takes onehalf damage. Other creatures are affected as follows: Lawful creatures are slowed (as by the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save). Non-lawful creatures take 6d6 points of force damage (no save) and are stunned for 1d4 rounds (DC 26 Fortitude save negates). Should the ruby star of law ever be claimed as a magic item, treat it as a minor artifact that allows use of the energy ray ability indicated above, save that it requires a standard action to activate.

Hypnotic Lights (Su) The corpse candle possesses the ability to create a dancing, twisting pattern of ever-shifting lights that slowly change colors.  The corpse candle can create these lights within 20 feet of itself, covering an area in a 10foot radius spread (usually underwater). Creatures viewing the pattern within 50 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 18) or become fascinated. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that corpse candle's hypnotic lights for one day. The lights remain for as long as the corpse candle concentrates plus 1 minute. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A fascinated victim moves toward the lights, taking the most direct route available at its normal movement rate. The creature avoids certain dangers (walking off a cliff, walking through fire, etc.) and skirts around such obstructions if possible, but it will swim towards the light if necessary, paying no heed to the need for air. If no path to the light is available, the fascination is broken. Any living creature within the area of light at the end of its turn takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Crucify Soul (Su) Five times per day as an attack action a crucifixion spirit can point at a single living target within 60 feet and crucify its soul. This requires the crucifixion spirit to succeed at a ranged touch attack. If successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed, crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it. A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each round thereafter. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22. The save DCs are Charisma-based. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks against a different opponent. A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by making a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The target is stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally. A creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.

Teleport Other (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a crypt thing can teleport all creatures within 50 feet of it to a randomly determined location.  An affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  An affected creature is teleported in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; 4, west) and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing. Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving throw.  A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the determined destination. A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that arrives in mid-air takes falling damage when it contacts a solid surface (unless it has some means to prevent falling, such as the ability to fly, or a feather fall spell).

Crypt Guardian
DESC:There exists in some parts of the world (and perhaps only truly in legend; sages aren't sure) a variant of the crypt thing known as a crypt guardian. This variant has all the same abilities and powers as a normal crypt thing, with the following changes. The variant does not possess the teleport other ability. Instead, it possesses an ability known as cloak other.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Cloak Other (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a crypt guardian can simultaneously paralyze and turn invisible all creatures within 50 feet. An affected creature can make a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects (only one save is required; if it succeeds, both effects are negated). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Affected creatures remain paralyzed and invisible for 2d4 days. A new save is allowed each day until the effects are broken, dispelled, or the duration ends.

Bend Light (Ex) By shifting the make-up of its body as a standard action, a crystalline horror can refract natural light into a bright light that radiates out in a 10-foot spread. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be blinded for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Creatures to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural take 2d6 points of damage from the light. Undead creatures caught within the area take 3d6 points of damage, and undead particularly vulnerable to sunlight, such as vampires, take 3d8 points of damage. Creatures that cannot see or perceive objects through the use of vision are unaffected by the blindness, but still suffer damage if they are vulnerable to sunlight.
