a single whole creature again (add the two creatures’ hit points together). If one of the split creatures is slain, the amphisbaena can regrow the lost portion over the course of a few weeks.

ANIMAL LORDS

For every animal species, there is a single ruler or lord, looked upon by
those animals as a minor deity of sorts.  The animal lord is the master of
that species; for example, there is a fox lord, mouse lord, and a cat lord.
Each animal can assume two forms: human and animal. Its animal form is always
of a member of the species it represents.

Animal lords are seen as protectors of nature and animals. They may step in
and prevent hunters from destroying  a race of animals or foresters from
completely decimating a forest. They do not, however, interfere with nature
itself (i.e., animals die, they are killed for food or clothing)—such is the
way of the universe.

Change Shape (Su) The Cat Lord can assume the shape of a human as a standard action. In human form, the Cat Lord cannot use his natural weapons or his howl, pounce, spit, or rake special attacks but can wield weapons and wear armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Cat Lord retains his movement modes (and speeds) in human form.

Howl (Su) When the Cat Lord howls, all creatures except felines within a 20-foot spread must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the Cat Lord’s howl for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Immortality (Su) The Cat Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Cat Lord’s soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within 9 days, it inhabits another feline on the Material Plane and the Cat Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap his soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Cat Lord, it is thought that one must destroy every feline in existence (so his soul has no creature to inhabit).

A creature hit must succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save or be blinded. Remove blindness or dispel magic (vs. CL 19th) removes the blindness effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid slain by an apparition be- comes an apparition itself in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical apparitions, and suffer a –2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks. They also receive –2 hp per HD, and a -2 penalty to the Will save DC of their spectral strangulation ability. Spawn are under the command of the apparition that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed apparitions. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Spectral Strangulation (Su) An apparition attacks an opponent by implanting a suggestion in the victim’s mind, convincing it that it is being strangled by the apparition’s bony claws. The apparition must be on the same plane as the target creature to use this ability.  The target of the spectral strangulation feels the bony, claw-like fingers of the apparition at its throat—even through armor. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Will save to disbelieve the suggestion. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same apparition’s suggestion for one day.  On a failed save, the victim must immediately succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or die from fright due to heart failure. If the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim acts as if affected by a fear spell for 1d4 rounds. A creature protected by magic circle against evil or protection from evil cannot be affected by an apparition’s spectral strangulation. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charismabased.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell would otherwise deal (non-damaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell level). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they affect the arcanoplasm. The arcanoplasm cannot absorb divine magic and is affected normally by such magic.

The spell takes effect as if cast by a 7th-level sorcerer (save DC 14 + spell level) and does not require any components. The arcanoplasm cannot mimic spells a 7th-level arcane caster could not normally cast (i.e., it cannot mimic divine spells, or arcane spells of 5th level or higher). The save DC is Charisma-based.  Due to their innately magical nature, an arcanoplasm adds its Constitution modifier in addition to its Charisma modifier to all concentration checks to cast a spell using arcane spell mimicry.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Spores (Ex) Once per round, an ascomoid can fire deadly spores in a 30-foot line. Upon impacting a solid surface, the spores billow into a cloud that fills a 20-foot radius. The cloud lasts 1 round before dispersing. Creatures caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A successful save negates the Constitution damage but not the nauseated condition. Once a creature saves against this ability it is immune to the same ascomoid’s spores for 24 hours.
