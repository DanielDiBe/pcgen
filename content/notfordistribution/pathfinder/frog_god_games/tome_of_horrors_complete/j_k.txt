AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Charm (Su) Once per day, a kelpie can produce an effect identical to the charm monster spell (caster level 9th). The target can make a DC 17 Will save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly as possible toward the kelpie.  The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm ability; only males can be affected. The charm is negated if the victim dies, the kelpie dies, or dispel magic, greater dispelling, miracle, or wish is cast on the victim. If the save is successful, the target cannot be affected by that kelpie's charm or charm touch for 24 hours.  The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Charm Touch (Su) On a successful slam attack, a kelpie's target must make a DC 17 or be charmed as described under the charm ability above. This effect does not stack with that ability.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Reshape Form (Su) A kelpie's natural form is that of a mass of dark green seaweed. It can assume three other forms. The first is a Small or Medium female humanoid. The second form is a hippocampus (see that entry). The third form is a Large green horse. In each form, the kelpie retains all of her special abilities. She does not truly alter her form (such as shapechangers do), she simply reshapes her body. In all of her forms, the kelpie's skin/fur has a greenish cast, and her features are slightly distorted. The kelpie's ruse can be detected if an opponent who is not charmed succeeds on a DC 10 Perception check.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Telepathy (Su) A kelpie can communicate telepathically to a range of 1 mile with any creature she has touched.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Earth Glide (Ex) A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Rend Armor (Ex) If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage). Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed and devoured by the khargra.  Damaged armor gains the broken condition.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sundering Bite (Ex) A khargra can making a sunder attempt with its bite attack against an opponent's weapon or shield without provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve this using the normal rules for a sunder attempt. If the khargra succeeds on its CMB roll, it deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the weapon or shield. Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield's hardness is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra's sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.  It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the broken condition.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerabilities (Ex) A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell (no save). A transmute metal to wood deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to a khargra. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 17 + caster's ability modifier) to reduce the damage by half.

Its hair is dark and its wild, brown eyes have an almost feral-like gleam in them.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Animate Hair (Su) A korred can weave its hair (contained in its pouch) into animated ropes that can entangle foes. The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows: Size | Time || Up to Tiny | 1 round || Small or Medium | 2 rounds || Large | 3 rounds || A korred cannot entangle an opponent of greater than Large size. This ability otherwise is similar to the animate rope spell (caster level 15th)

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Laugh (Su) Three times per day, a korred can unleash a laugh that stuns all creatures that hear it within 60 feet for 1d2 rounds. A DC 14 Will save negates the effects. A bard's countersong ability allows a stunned creature a new Will save to break free. Whether the save is successful or not, a creature is immune to the laugh of the same korred for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
