Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 2 rounds as a standard
action, an ectoplasm can release a 20-foot cone of ectoplasmic goo at its foes. Affected opponents must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be affected as if by a sleep spell (caster level 7th). A successful save renders a
creature immune to that ectoplasm's breath weapon for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Glow (Su) An ectoplasm continually gives off light with the approximate brightness of a candle. It cannot consciously extinguish this light. When an ectoplasm is killed, this light fades to darkness.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Manifestation (Su) An ectoplasm dwells on the Ethereal Plane and as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When an
ectoplasm manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal. A manifested ectoplasm can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ectoplasm can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ectoplasm always moves silently.

DESC:This creature resembles a miniature black hole hovering several feet off the ground. It is a circular region of absolute blackness, with a bizarre distortion around its edges as it warps light waves. Four spiraling, rotating arms of debris and light surround the circular region of darkness. Its facial features are small points of light, almost like stars.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Distortion (Su) The manipulation of light waves around a gravity elemental grants it a +2 deflection bonus to its Armor Class.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or
holding and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature
or object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature
or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it
remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by
rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental gains
the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only
engulf one creature at a time.

A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into
atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention
of a deity. An object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity
elemental is destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1%
non-cumulative chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent
to a random plane.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to any attack
from thrown or hurled weapons, arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with
a size equal to or less than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity
elemental automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's
body.

Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it desires,
and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised thrown weapon.
The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity elemental's Strength
modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A gravity elemental has the
Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Gravity Field (Su) A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like
the reverse gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum
weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not
restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the
gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of
gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain
radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp.

Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal
creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the
gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the
held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A
flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is
unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The
gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action.
The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the
gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature
can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the
initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller
less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if
the Strength check is successful.  This ability only works on creatures with
weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power.

Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can
increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within
the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful
Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC
depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.



AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Spells (Ex) A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and effects that depend on weight or mass.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Perfect Flier (Ex) A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight, such as strong winds.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Throes (Su) A negative energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of swirling negative energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its negative energy aura). Living creatures within the area take 1d8 points of negative energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Negative energy based creatures and undead gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's negative energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's negative energy save DC) reduces the damage by half.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Negative Energy (Ex) A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative	energy based creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is Constitution based. See the table below for each negative energy elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Negative Energy Aura (Su) A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other negative energy elementals.  Within a negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot.  If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally.


AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Negative Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Blinding Flash (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a positive energy elemental of at least Medium size can release a burst of pure energy in a 10-foot radius. Creatures viewing this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Death Throes (Su) A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura). Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC) reduces the damage by half.  All creatures in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Positive Energy (Ex) A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy. This dealse xtra damage to an undead or negative energy based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later.  Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy. The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each positive energy elemental's save DC.  Positive energy (such as a cure spell or positive energy channeling) can heal positive energy elementals.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC: 
Positive Energy Aura (Su) A positive energy elemental radiates an aura of pure positive energy around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots).  Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not affect the positvi e energy channeling ability of the positive energy elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other positive energy elementals.  Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negatvie energy, including inflict spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC: 
Positive Energy Channeling (Su) A Large or larger positive energy elemental can channel positive energy as a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC includes a +2 racial bonus.

TIME ELEMENTAL
Languages telepathy 100 ft.

Environment Plane of Time
Organization solitary, troupe (noble plus 1-2 common time elementals), or court (royal plus 1-2 nobles and 1-4 common time elementals)
Treasure none

Alter Age (Su) Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack.  An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age.  A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger).  Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day.

Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell.

Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common).

Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spelllike abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time.  Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all.

Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based.  When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day.  Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).

ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCTS
DESC:Elemental constructs are golems or automatons forged of one of the four basic elements-air, earth, fire, or water-bound to serve their creator. The creation of an elemental construct requires no less than five elemental spirits(of the same type) which are unwillingly bound into the form of the elemental construct.  Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability.

An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else's control, and so on), but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.

Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.

Construction
An elemental construct's body is formed completely of one of the four elements air, earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the finest quality or purest form taken from the respective plane and mixed with rare oils, powders, and other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An air elemental construct is immune to any spell or spelllike ability that allows spell resistance.  In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.

A control weather spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to an air elemental construct.  The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 17 + caster's relevant ability score modifier) for half damage.

An iron body or ice storm spell slows (as the slow spell) an air elemental construct for 2d6 rounds. Note the iron body spell does not change the construct's form, nor does an ice storm spell actually damage the construct.

A control winds spell heals an air elemental construct of all of its lost hit points.

Insubstantial Form (Ex) An air elemental construct cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other liquids. It can pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell-note the air elemental construct is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell.) Any piercing or slashing attack against an air elemental construct has a 20% miss chance. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.

Wind Blast (Ex) An air elemental construct can transform the air in radius around it into a forceful blast of wind and debris. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A cold effect slows a fire elemental construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. This is in addition to any damage it takes because of its vulnerability to cold.  A quench spell negates the fire elemental construct's damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round. Any water-based spell of 5th level or higher deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the fire elemental construct. The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + caster's relevant ability score modifier) to half the damage.  Any fire-based spell or effect heals 1 point of damage on the fire elemental construct for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

The weapon automatically returns to the elemental fiend's hand even if the weapon is being held by another creature.



An elemental fiend is a rare creature from one of the elemental planes that takes the form of a roughly human-sized pillar of its native element. Upon first glance, an elemental fiend strongly resembles an elemental of the same size, but beyond that the resemblance ends. It has three faces, three legs, and an arm between each face. Each arm wields a masterwork melee weapon of unknown origin. Its three faces constantly scowl and scream at opponents, howling and babbling vulgar curses in its native tongue.

An elemental fiend attacks primarily with its weapons. It positions itself in such a way as to bring as many weapons to bear on a single opponent as possible. Because each face controls an arm, it can attack with all three weapons in one round without penalty. An elemental fiend cannot battle a single opponent with more than two of its weapons, but it can battle one, two, or three different opponents at the same time.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
All-Around Vision (Ex) An eye of the deep's stalked eyes allow it to see in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Eye Rays (Su) Each of the creature's eyes stalks can produce a magical ray once per round as a free action.  The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any direction. Each of its eye rays resembles a spell cast by a 12th-level caster and follows the rules for a ray (see Aiming a Spell in the Core Rulebook). Each eye ray has a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 17. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Hold Person Left eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. An eye of the deep will use this ray early in a fight so as to disable its opponents. Hold Monster Right eye-A target struck by this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. This is used in the same manner as the hold person ray. Minor Image By combining the rays of both eyes, the eye of the deep can replicate the minor image spell. It does not have to succeed on an attack roll to use this ray. The illusion is generated at any point within range and in the eye of the deep's line of sight.


AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Stun Cone (Su) An eye of the deep's central eye can, once per round, produce a cone extending straight ahead from its front to a range of 30 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Feats An eye of the deep's Flyby Attack feat allows it to take a move action and another standard action at any point during the move while swimming. It cannot take a second move action during a round in which it makes a flyby attack.
