Quantum
DESC:This creature seems to have no true shape, as its outline flickers and changes seemingly at random. At first it appears to have four tentacles, then in a flicker eight more appear and waver menacingly before shimmering once more out of existence. Its general shape is serpentine, with an uncertain number of tentacles dangling beneath it, but the only constants are its six glowing eyes, three on each side of what must be its head.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Disintegration (Su) Three times per day, as a full-round action, a quantum can attack with a single tentacle.  If it hits, it sets up subatomic vibrations that shake apart the molecular structure of its opponent. The target must succeed on a DC 32 Fortitude save or take 40d6 points of damage. Even if the save succeeds, the target takes 10d6 points of damage. This effect functions as a disintegrate spell (CL 34th). A quantum can use this ability when it uses its quantum form. Each use by one of its forms counts against its daily use limit. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Quantum Form (Su) Three times per day and once per round, a quantum can move in such a way as to appear in two places at once, at a distance no greater than 30 feet. This is a free action that provokes an attack of opportunity and lasts only one round. While occupying two spaces simultaneously, each representation of the quantum can perform one independent standard action (including using the quantum's special attacks). Using this ability, the same quantum could attack two different opponents, or attack one opponent while opening a door to escape, and so on. At the end of the round, both instances of the quantum return to the space it originally occupied before activating this ability.

Unstable Form (Su) A quantum has a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Charisma bonus. Further, because it moves by means of short-distance teleportation, attacks aimed at a quantum have a 20% miss chance.

Acid (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals are living creatures of acid; any melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's slam attack.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acid Swimmer (Ex) Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic nature of their environment on their home plane.

Drench (Ex) The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals the quasi-elemental's HD).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vulnerability to Water (Ex) An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by water. An acid	quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water onto an acid quasielemental requires a successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level to an acid quasielemental within its area of effect. Damage from waterbased attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction does not occur when the acid quasielemental touches water, only when water touches the acid quasi-elemental.

A creature striking the lightning quasielemental unarmed, or a creature striking the lightning quasi-elemental with a weapon take this same electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits. Metallic creatures or creatures using metal weapons take an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage each time one of their attacks hits.

Globe (Ex) As a standard action, a lightning quasielemental can discharge one globe of electricity per HD it possesses once per round. Globes hover by the quasielemental and move with the creature. An opponent that moves within 5 feet of a lightning quasi-elemental discharges a globe and takes the electricity damage shown on the table below. An affected creature can make a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. Once a globe discharges, it is destroyed and a lightning quasi-elemental cannot recreate it for 4 hours.

A typical quickwood (11 HD) has 9 roots it uses to grab foes. For every 2 HD above 11, a quickwood has one additional root it can use in combat (thus, a 13 HD quickwood has 10 roots and a 15 HD quickwood has 11 roots).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Fear Aura (Su) If a quickwood is targeted by a spell (excluding area spells) and it makes its save against the spell's effects, it takes no damage and absorbs some of the spell's energy and releases it as a fear effect (as a free action) in a 10-foot radius per level of the spell. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as by a fear spell (caster level 11th). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Grasping Roots (Ex) If a quickwood hits with a root attack, it can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and drags the foe 30 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity). A quickwood can draw in a creature within 15 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round. A root has hardness 2 and 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a quickwood's root does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the root is currently grappling a target, the quickwood takes a -4 penalty on its CMD to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a root deals no damage to a quickwood.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Fire (Ex) A quickwood can perspire as a free action; this grants it immunity to fire for one hour.  Afterwards, it must wait one minute before using this ability again.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Remote Sensing (Su) As a standard action, a quickwood can use a normal oak tree within 360 feet as a magical sensor to view its surroundings. This ability is similar to a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and allows a quickwood to see (including with darkvision) and hear through a sensor.

A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the tormenting howl of that raggoth for 24 hours.

If a rakkelthorn toad is killed or subdued before it has fired all of its thorns in a given day, the poison can be extracted from its remaining thorns. A successful DC 16 Heal or Craft (alchemy) check allows the poison to be changed into a mild anesthetic; one rakkelthorn toad provides enough for one dose. A single dose of this anesthetic, applied to the wound of an injured creature, provides a +2 circumstance bonus to Heal checks (multiple doses do not stack). This bonus lasts for one hour, after which time the anesthesia wears off. Poison cannot be extracted from thorns that have been fired by the rakklethorn.

Jester's Deck (Su) The red jester uses a deck of playing cards in combat that functions as a deck of many things (Pathfinder RPG core rulebook, 544-555). Once per round, as a standard action, the red jester can draw a single card and throw it at an opponent to a range of 20 feet. This requires a successful ranged touch attack. If successful, the card takes effect that round and affects the target just as if he had drawn a card from a deck of many things. A red jester can draw the same card more than once. The playing cards only function in the hands of a red jester. To anyone else, they are merely normal playing cards.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Merriment (Su) If a red jester strikes an opponent with its mace, the creature must make a successful DC 20 Will save or fall to the ground laughing for 1d3 rounds. The opponent is not helpless, but is unable to move or act for the duration.  A mace of merriment functions only in the hands of a red jester. In the hands of any other creature it functions as a masterwork light mace.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Unassailable Mind (Ex) The mind of a red jester is a twisted and dangerous place to journey. Being undead, it is immune to all mind-influencing effects and should a creature target the mind of a red jester with such an effect (including psionics, telepathy, or the like), the creature attempting to invade the red jester's mind must make a successful DC Will save or suffer the effects of an insanity spell (caster level 15th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Alignment Subtype (Ex) Because a reliquary is infused with a spark from their creator's deity, the creature gains the appropriate subtype(s) based on its alignment. Thus, a lawful good reliquary guardian has both the Good and Lawful subtypes. In addition, a reliquary guardian's weapons and natural attacks can overcome this type of damage reduction as if its weapons and natural attacks had an alignment (or alignments) that match the reliquary guardian's subtype(s).
Further, its damage reduction is based on its alignment subtype(s). Thus a chaotic evil reliquary guardian has damage reduction 10/lawful and good while a lawful good reliquary guardian has damage reduction 10/chaotic and evil.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A reliquary guardian is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a reliquary guardian, as noted below.  A dispel (chaos/evil/good/law) spell targeted against an appropriately aligned reliquary guardian deals 4d6 points of damage to it.  A blasphemy spell heals an evil-aligned reliquary guardian of all its lost hit points. Likewise, a dictum spell heals a lawaligned reliquary guardian; a holy word spell heals a goodaligned reliquary guardian; and a word of chaos spell heals a chaos-aligned reliquary guardian.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Magic Weapon (Ex) A reliquary guardian carries a +1 greatsword with an alignment special quality that matches its alignment on the good-evil axis or the law-chaos axis. Thus, a chaotic evil reliquary guardian might carry a +1 anarchic greatsword or a +1 unholy greatsword while a lawful good reliquary guardian would carry either a +1 axiomatic greatsword or a +1 holy greatsword.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Pronouncement (Su) Once per day, a reliquary guardian can make a pronouncement that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. This pronouncement otherwise functions as a blasphemy, dictum, holy word, or word of chaos spell. Note: a reliquary guardian only has one type of pronouncement. It is set during the construction process based on the creator's alignment and the reliquary guardian's alignment and cannot be changed.

The Will save, where applicable, has a DC of 21. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Blasphemy: CE, LE, or NE reliquary guardians.
Dictum: LG, LE, or LN reliquary guardians.
Holy Word: CG, LG, or NG reliquary guardians.
Word of Chaos: CE, CG, or CN reliquary guardians.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A reliquary guardian has a total of five spell-like abilities (one each of spell levels 1st thru 5th), each usable once per day. Its spell-like abilities are based on its alignment and are drawn from one of the following cleric domains: Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law. A reliquary guardian whose alignment is CE, CG, LG, or LE must be assigned a single domain (one that matches one of its alignment axes) during construction. This domain can never be changed.  Regardless of the reliquary guardian's alignment, its spelllike abilities function at caster level 16th. The save DCs are Wisdom-based.

Construction

Reliquary guardians are created for a specific purpose, be it the guarding
of a saint's tomb or protection of a detailed item or place of religious significance to its creator and the creator's deity. A reliquary guardian is crafted from 3,000 pounds of purest marble which is sprinkled with various exotic powders. The total cost is at least 5,000 gp for its body. The color of the marble it is crafted from denotes the predominant alignment of the deity and creator: white marble (good-aligned), green marble (chaos-aligned), red marble (law-aligned), black marble (evil-aligned).

RELIQUARY GUARDIAN
CL 16th; Price 175,000 gp

Requirements Craft Construct, commune, geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, and one of the following spells (protection from evil, good, chaos, law) and one of the following (blasphemy, dictum, holy word, word of chaos), creator must be caster level 16th; Skill Craft (sculpting) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 21; Cost 90,000 gp

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Stony Hide (Ex) A stone roper's tough hide renders it immune to damage from nonmagical ranged attacks, save those of unusually large size (such as boulders hurled by a giant).

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Strands (Ex) Most encounters with a stone roper begin when it fires up to six strong, sticky strands up to 50 feet away (no range increment). A roper's attacks with its strands are treated as ranged touch attacks. Strands can be severed by any amount of slashing damage (a strand is AC 20). Once a strand has successfully struck a victim, it remains attached until severed or retracted by the stone roper (which it may do as a free action). Attached strands do no further Strength damage, but the struck individual is subject to the pull effect each round, and is subject to the stone roper's venom pulse ability.  A creature that begins its turn attached to a strand is numbed and weakened by the strange material, and for each strand attached must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based, and poison resistances and immunities apply.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Venom Pulse (Ex) Twice per day, a stone roper can exude a pulse of venom through all of its attached strands as a free action. A creature attached to a strand must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed (multiple attached strands to not require multiple saves or increase the save DC). A paralyzed creature appears to have been turned to stone (DC 20 Spot check or close inspection reveals that this is in fact not the case). One round after being paralyzed, the victim recovers and must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or act as if under the effects of a charm monster spell for 2d4 minutes. A charmed creature fights for and defends the stone roper. If the stone roper is killed, a charmed victim acts as if under the effects of a confusion spell for 1d6+2 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based, and poison resistances and immunities apply.

Camouflage (Ex): Because it remains buried until it attacks, it takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to detect the presence of a sand kraken before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the sand kraken.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Tentacles (Ex): The only part of a sand kraken that is normally exposed is its tentacles. For combat purposes, the creature's tentacles are treated as separate weapons.  A single tentacle has an AC 20 (touch 14) and 15 hit points. Once a tentacle takes more than 15 hit points of damage, it is destroyed. A sand kraken can no longer use the destroyed tentacle to make attacks, however the loss of a tentacle cause the creature no other penalties. Furthermore, damage dealt to a tentacle does not count against the creature's total hit points. Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.

Attraction (Ex) The front four legs of a sand stalker are hollow. When a gust of air or wind blows across them, they create a hypnotic sound that can be heard by all creatures within a 100-foot spread. Those hearing this sound must make a successful DC 15 Will save or become entranced. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same sand stalker's attraction for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An entranced victim takes the most direct route possible, walking toward the sand stalker. If the path leads into a dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so on), that creature gets a second saving throw. Entranced creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand stalker stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the sand stalker's legs are subjected to wind. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.

The effects of multiple screaming devilkin using their scream ability in an overlapping area is not cumulative; only one save need be made each round. Conversation, even shouting, is inaudible within 60 feet of a screaming devilkin using this ability.

Cacophony (Su) When a screaming skull detects movement within 40 feet, it emits an ear-shattering roar of tumultuous sounds as a free action that can be heard up to 1,000 feet away. All creatures within 60 feet that hear the sound must make a successful DC 13 Will save or take 1d6 points of sonic damage each round they remain in the area. The screaming also distracts spellcasters attempting to cast spells. A spellcaster within the area must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to successfully cast a spell. The screaming lasts for 1d4 rounds before ceasing for one round. After that, the skull remains silent unless a creature is within or moves within 40 feet of it-it then screams again and repeats the above cycle. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Additionally, this cacophonous scream risks attracts wandering monsters. Whenever the skull first screams, the GM makes an additional wandering monster check to determine if nearby creatures come to investigate the source of the disturbance.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Boil Water (Ex) If a scylla uses its heat ability (see below) for 3 consecutive rounds and doesn't move more than 5 feet from its current location, the water surrounding it (in a 10-foot radius and to a depth of 10 feet) begins to rapidly churn and boil. Creatures caught in the boiling water take 3d6 points of fire damage each round they remain in the area. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Creatures wearing heavy clothing or medium or heavy armor take a -2 penalty on their saving throw. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Once the scylla moves from its location or shuts its heat ability off, the boiling water takes 3 rounds to return to its normal temperature (it still deals full damage during its cooling off period). A scylla is immune to its own boil water ability and to the boil water ability of other scyllas.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Heat (Ex) A scylla raises the temperature of its body in order to generate intense heat. It does so as a free action. Creatures attacking a scylla unarmed or with natural weapons take 1d6 points of fire damage each time their attacks hit. In addition, a scylla can use its heat ability to boil the surrounding waters.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Scalding Blast (Ex) A scylla can gulp some of the boiling water surrounding it as a move action. Each head that gulped water can then unleash a line of scalding steam on the scylla's next action to a range of 50 feet. The scylla can target the same or different opponents with each head, if it wishes. Each blast deals 3d6 points of fire damage or half that amount if the target succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is effective both on the surface and underwater.  In any round that a head does not gulp water, it can bite.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

SEA SERPENTS
DESC:Nearly as old as the dragons that roam the sky are the sea serpents, great snakelike creatures that have roamed the oceans for ages. Unlike the classical dragon, these great, scaly, serpentine beasts are generally agreed to be a product of evolution, though many suspect magical influence, either deliberate or natural, somewhere in their evolution.

Whatever their origins, sea serpents are a highly varied species, with a great variation in size, coloration, intellect, and temperament. However, all sea serpents bear certain similarities. They are long, serpentine, warmblooded creatures that closely resemble snakes in appearance, though they all have two sets of flippers, which may be large or so small and atrophied as to be nearly unnoticeable. Sea serpents are aquatic creatures, though some can make their way about on land. All sea serpents can breathe both water and air with equal efficiency, another fact that distinguishes them from marine mammals and reptiles. Further, all sea serpents are sentient, with an intellect ranging from little greater than moronic to supra-genius level.

One trait that sea serpents share in common with their draconic brethren is a sense of innate superiority, a feeling that they are masters of the sea, at least in whatever manner they choose to pursue their expertise.

Unlike dragons, however, sea serpents are not distinguished by color or age category. And while some species are as acquisitive as dragons, others have no interest in hoarding wealth, and live lives little better than beasts.

All sea serpents can speak and understand Aquatic, and many know Draconic as well. The more intelligent species may also learn the languages of marine civilizations, or the languages of sea-traveling surface dwellers. Due to their physical similarities, sea serpents use fairly consistent tactics in combat situations. All sea serpents have venomous bites, and they use this to their advantage to slow or immobilize multiple attackers so they can concentrate on one foe. In addition to their lethal bite, all sea serpents have the ability to ensnare prey in their coils as a giant constrictor does and crush the life out of them. The larger sea serpents may even use this constriction attack against sea vessels, and mariners in their smoky dens delight in recounting tales of horror and woe of great serpents that
splinter hulls and then devour the helpless sailors in the water.

Because they are sentient beings, sea serpents can often be reasoned with, even if the reasoning is no more complex than simple intimidation. They are adaptable to circumstances, and none throw themselves into battle rashly.
Feats: All sea serpents have Swim-By Attack as a bonus feat.

Cocoon (Su) Three times per day, a sepia snake can fire a line of webbing to a range of 20 feet. A creature caught in the path can make a successful DC 20 Reflex save to avoid the web.

When a foe is completely covered in webbing, it must make a successful DC 20 Fortitude save or be placed in a state of suspended animation as per the sepia snake sigil spell for 1d4+12 days. The save DCs are Constitution-based.  In one round, the sepia snake can spit enough webbing to cover one Medium or smaller creature. For each size category larger than Medium, the snake must fire another line of webbing to completely encase an opponent. Victims hit by the webbing, but not completely covered, can break free in one round by making a successful DC 24 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each 5-foot section of webbing has 10 hit points. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus.

Deafening Roar (Su) Whenever a slag worm moves at least half of its speed in a single round it creates a grinding roar of metal on metal from its body. Creatures within 50 feet that hear this grinding roar must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be deafened for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Intense Heat (Ex) A slag worm's body generates intense heat. Anything within 10 feet of its body takes 4d6 points of fire damage each round. A DC 30 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Any weapon that strikes a slag worm must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or melt into slag. (Magic weapons gain their enhancement bonus to their save.) A creature striking a slag worm with a natural attack or unarmed takes the same 4d6 points of damage each time an attack hits. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fire Absorption (Ex) Fire deals no damage to a slag worm. Instead, the slag worm absorbs the effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points the effect would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the slag worm to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.

The sleeping willow heals 5 points of damage whenever it drains Constitution, gaining temporary hit points (if bonus hit points exceed the sleeping willows total). At Constitution 0, the creature dies and its body is absorbed by the sleeping willow's roots. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) A slime mold looks like a normal patch of fungus when at rest. It takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the ooze. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) A slithering tracker can engulf a paralyzed foe up to one size larger than itself as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The slithering tracker merely has to move into a space occupied by a paralyzed creature, completely covering it.  An engulfed opponent is subjected to the slithering tracker's paralysis and plasma drain, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its body.  A slithering tracker only uses this ability against a paralyzed, sleeping, or otherwise helpless opponent.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Plasma Drain (Ex) A slithering tracker drains the body fluids from an engulfed opponent. Each 5 minutes an opponent is engulfed, it takes 1 point of Constitution damage. Because it takes a long time to completely drain a foe, a slithering tracker generally only uses this ability against a paralyzed, stunned, held, or sleeping opponent.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sealed Mind (Ex) Even though a slithering tracker has an Intelligence score, it is immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) just as other oozes are.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Link to Caster (Ex) When a soul eater is summoned to the Material Plane, it creates a mental link between itself and the caster who summoned it. If a soul eater's victim (i.e., the creature it is summoned to slay) is killed before the creature can devour its soul, the soul eater returns at full speed to the caster and attacks him. Likewise, if a soul eater is defeated in battle (but not slain) by its target, the creature returns to the caster and attacks him. So long as both the caster and soul eater are on the same plane of existence, the soul eater can successfully locate the caster (again as though guided by discern location). If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns, or the soul eater enters a plane the caster is on, the link is immediately restored.

Essence Ingots

Essence ingots are small rectangular bricks of blackened stone that contain the soul of a living creature. Creatures are trapped in essence ingots through the use of a great smelter, the location of which has been lost.

A trapped spirit can be released by casting remove curse (or similar and more powerful magic). A released soul reforms its material body in 1d4 rounds. An essence ingot has a hardness 5, hp 10, and Break DC 20. Note, however, that if an essence ingot is broken, the trapped soul is not released but is lost forever.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Soul Slash (Su) If a soul reaper scores a critical hit with its scythe, the target must succeed on a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its soul torn from its body and pulled into the soul reaper's scythe. If the save succeeds, the victim takes an extra 3d6 points of damage. A soul reaper's scythe can hold a number of souls equal to its Charisma bonus (four souls for a typical soul reaper). This effect is similar to a trap the soul spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.  A creature's soulless body collapses into a desiccated husk, and in one day crumbles to dust.  To reclaim a captured soul, the reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground. When the scythe is shattered, all souls trapped are released and seek their original body (if it's been less than one day since the body was killed). Creatures without a body are left to wander in spirit form but can be returned to life through the successful casting of a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.

Inseparable Weapon (Su) A soul reaper has a mystic and magical connection to its scythe. If separated from its scythe (if the soul reaper is disarmed, for example) and within 100 feet of it, it may summon it to its hands as a move action. If an opponent is holding the weapon when the reaper summons it, that opponent must succeed on a DC 26 Strength check or the weapon flies from its hands to the soul reaper. The check DC is Charisma-based.

Spriggan
DESC:Spriggans are among the ugliest and certainly the most foul tempered of all gnomes. At one moment a normal-sized gnome, a spriggan can grow to giant-sized in an instant, gaining immense strength and taking unsuspecting opponents by surprise.

Spriggans are, by human standards, quite homely. They have stocky bodies and sickly ochre-colored skin and dark hair of brown of black. Male spriggans favor facial hair such as shaggy mustaches and ratty beards, but any head or facial hair they have is unkempt and filthy. Female spriggans do not have facial hair. Being unhygienic creatures, spriggans never bathe or clean their clothing or equipment. Thanks to their filthy lifestyle, spriggans reek with the foulness of dirt, body odor, and other unpleasantness. Despite being gnomes themselves, spriggans despise all of their gnomish kinfolk.

A typical spriggan stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 to 55 pounds. An enlarged spriggan stands about 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs 500 to 550 pounds.

Spriggans make the best use of their magical abilities in combat. When several spriggans are encountered, some will enlarge themselves at the first sign of melee, while the remainder will stay Small and take advantage of their innate abilities of stealth and sneak attacks. Owing to their chaotic nature, complex battle plans are generally beyond most spriggan mobs; it is likely that some, none, or all spriggans in a mob will change size at the start of melee.

Size Alteration (Su) At will, a spriggan can grow from Small to Large size or back again. Weapons, armor, and other inanimate objects on its person grow proportionately with it when it changes size. This is similar to the enlarge person spell. An enlarged spriggan gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a -2 to AC. While enlarged, a spriggan cannot use its spell-like abilities or its innate sneak attack ability (though any other sneak attack it may have, such as from rogue class levels, is unaffected when it changes size).

Sea Sprite

Sea sprites are the aquatic version of normal sprites. As their name implies, they are joyful fey who dwell in the sea. Their hair resembles strands of seaweed and they have large, fish-like eyes. The skin of a sea sprite is pale blue. Lacking wings, sea sprites cannot fly, but thanks to fine webbing in their fingers and toes they are adept swimmers. Sea sprites can breathe both air and water without difficulty. Like normal sprites, sea sprites make use of special ammunition that put their opponents to sleep. Sea sprites have the same statistics as their land-dwelling brethren, with the following exceptions: They have the aquatic and amphibious subtypes; they do not have a fly speed but have a swim speed of 30 feet, and their Swim score is +12 (Swim score is based on their Dexterity, not their Strength). They employ crossbows rather than shortbows, and prefer spears over short swords.

Fronds (Ex) Strangle weed attacks with fronds that can extend up to 20 feet from its central mass. Each strangle weed has 3-12 fronds. A strangle weed attacks with these fronds as a slam attack; although it can make only one attack per round, if it grapples a foe it is not denied its Dexterity bonus against non-grappled foes and can still make attacks of opportunity if it has any free fronds.
