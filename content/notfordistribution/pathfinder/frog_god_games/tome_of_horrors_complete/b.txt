Chaos Burst (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a bedlam can release a burst of crackling gray energy in a 20-foot radius around itself. Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non-chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A successful DC 18 Will save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Chaotic Resonance (Su): A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic energy. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the bedlam.  Spellcasters in the area must make a successful DC 18 caster level check each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must make a successful DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round.  A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. These DCs are Constitution-based. Spells with the chaotic descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons (anarchic weapons) deal an additional +1d6 points of chaotic damage while in this aura (e.g., an anarchic weapon deals 3d6 total points of chaotic damage while in this aura). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura and also bypass the bedlam's damage reduction.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blood Drain (Ex) A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round that the hold is maintained. Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases victim so it can use it again later as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts unless they are extremely hungry.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Create Host (Ex) A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special poison sap into the victim that requires a DC 18 Will save, or the victim is transformed into a host. This acts as a dominate monster spell (caster level 8th) with no limit on its duration. Immunity or resistance to poison applies normally to this sap. The save DC is Constitutionbased.  A victim that becomes a host returns to the plant whenever it calls. It is normally used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack may be summoned for defense. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save with a +4 bonus to break the bloodsuckle's control.

Host Sense (Ex) A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any hosts within 100 feet.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Seed (Ex) Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage.  When its Constitution reaches 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell destroys the seedling.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Summon Host (Ex) As free action, a bloodsuckle can generate a high-pitched whine that only its hosts can hear.  A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant.  The whine can be heard by a host within 2 miles of the bloodsuckle.

These tendrils are quite strong (10 hp) but can be severed with a slashing weapon or a sunder combat maneuver. Attacking a bloody bones's tendril does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the tendril is currently wrapped around a target, the bloody bones takes a -4 penalty to CMD to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a tendril deals no damage to a bloody bones.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Bump in the Night (Su): A bogeyman can create a phantasmagoric image in the mind of a single creature within 200 feet. Such images cause the victim to see and hear things that are not really there or to see and hear things differently than they actually are. Things such as following footsteps, bumps and thumps from an unknown source, a gnarled tree with outstretched limbs scratching on a window or reaching for someone, the idea that someone or something is lurking around the corner, in the closet, or under the bed, and so on. A creature affected by the images takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if it fails a DC 19 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the bogeyman's Ability Focus feat. The bogeyman can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature who drops to Wisdom 0 is affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 8th) until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.

Shadow Shift (Su): A bogeyman has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A bogeyman can shift up to a total of 80 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 80 feet or multiple jumps of 10 feet each. This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Change Shape (Su) A boggart's natural form is that of a small humanoid (resembling a young gnome, halfling, or goblin). It has one other form: that of a small, immature will-o'-wisp. In humanoid form, a boggart assumes the same appearance and traits of its form, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, a boggart retains all of its special attacks and special qualities. The second form is that of a will-o- 'wisp. In this form, a boggart is nearly indistinguishable from a normal willo'-wisp, but a DC 18 Knowledge (dungeoneering) or Perception check reveals that the boggart is in fact smaller and brighter. A boggart can assume either form as a standard action, though it cannot maintain either one for longer than 1 minute (10 rounds). A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the boggart revert to its true natural form when slain. A true seeing spell reveals the boggart's natural form if it is in will-o'-wisp form.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Confusion (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a boggart can unleash a screech that confuses all those hearing it within 30 ft. of the boggart. The confusion lasts for 6 rounds. An affected creature can make a DC 15 Will save to negate the effects. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the screeching increases the save DC by +1. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Detect Thoughts (Su) A boggart can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 8th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

Electricity (Su) A boggart delivers 2d6 points of electricity damage with a successful slam attack (DC 15 Fortitude for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electrical Discharge (Su): Once every other round as a standard action, a boggart can discharge a bolt of electricity in a 10-foot line. The bolt deals 2d6 points of electricity damage (DC 15 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Feed (Su) When a boggart slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. A boggart advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a boggart devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an aberration of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill ranks, feats, and ability score improvements normally. The boggart only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A boggart that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a will-o'-wisp upon completion of the act.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Magic (Ex) Boggarts are immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except magic missile, protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and maze.

For each size category smaller than Medium a corpse is, reduce the time by 1 minute (to a minimum of 1 minute).

Poison (Ex) The bite of a boneneedle secretes a thick, syrupy neurotoxin that destroys flesh and quickly breaks down bone. The chemical reaction causes the bones to weaken and become brittle. If the opponent fails his save against the poison's secondary effect, its bones weaken, and it takes an extra 2 points of damage from any crushing or bludgeoning attack until all Dexterity damage dealt by marrow poisoning is healed. Cumulative bites do not increase the amount of extra damage beyond 2 points An opponent reduced to Dexterity 0 dies as its bones become too brittle to support its weight thus causing its body to collapse in on itself. Creatures without bone structures, such as constructs (except those crafted from bone), oozes, and plants, are immune to the effects of marrow poisoning.

A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.
