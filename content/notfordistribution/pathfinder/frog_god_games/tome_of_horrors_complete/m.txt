Energy Drain (Su) A magnesium spirit possessing a host deals 1 negative level to it each round if the host fails a DC 16 Will save. A magnesium spirit gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Negative levels remain for 24 hours, after which time the host can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove a negative level.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Soul Portal (Su) This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 8th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the magnesium spirit must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 17 Will save. If the save fails, the magnesium spirit vanishes into the target's body. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the creature's Ability Focus feat.  A magnesium spirit that has possessed an opponent's body deals a negative level to the host each round (see its energy drain attack above). When the host drops below 1st level, both it and the magnesium spirit vanish in a flash of white light as the spirit completes the ritual needed to return it to its plane of origin. Neither is ever seen again.  Each round, as a standard action, while the magnesium spirit inhabits its body, the host can attempt to eject the creature by making an opposed Wisdom check against the magnesium spirit's Wisdom check. If successful, the magnesium spirit is ejected and cannot use its soul portal ability against that creature again for 1 hour.  A magnesium spirit can be damaged by holy water even while merged with its host. Holy water deals 2d4 points of damage per vial to the creature. If it takes half or more of its current hit points in damage from holy water, it is ejected from the host's body. The host is stunned for 1d3 rounds.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Regardless of its type, a mantidrake's breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 5d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 19 Reflex save for half damage.  The save DC is Constitution-based.

Whistle (Su) A marble snake can whistle, gaining the attention of any creature within 50 feet that hears it. All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become entranced.  This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same marble snake's whistle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.  An entranced victim walks toward the marble snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. The effect continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively dazed (cannot attack, but can defend). If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is immediately broken. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will save.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Mimic Shape (Ex) A mawler can assume the general shape of any object that is roughly Tiny sized. A mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but it can alter the rigidity of its body to resemble metal, wood, and even stone. Most mawlers have found that taking on the shape of articles of clothing provides the most ready meals. The ruse can be detected by a Perception check opposed by the mawler's Disguise skill.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Vorpal Bite (Ex) A mawler that scores a critical hit with its bite attack while being worn severs the extremity that was inside it at the time. For example, a mawler being worn as a boot that scores a critical hit, severs the victim's leg. A mawler can only use its vorpal bite while being worn.  A creature that loses a limb suffers a -4 penalty to skill checks that require the use of two limbs. For example, a victim that loses a hand or arm suffers a -4 penalty to Climb checks, Disable Device checks, and so forth. Additionally, a creature that loses its primary weapon-wielding arm or hand suffers a -6 penalty when wielding a weapon in its offhand. A creature with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat that loses its primary arm or hand ignores the penalty for wielding a weapon in its offhand.  If the victim loses a foot or leg, the penalty applies to Acrobatics checks and the like. Additionally, the creature's speed is reduced to one-quarter. If the severed extremity happens to be the head, the victim dies immediately (unless it can live without its head).

A consecrate spell cast on a mortuary cyclone by a caster of 18th level or higher nullifies its desecrating aura for 1 minute per caster level.

Necrocone (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a mortuary cyclone can blast forth a mass of bone fragments, debris and negative energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take 6d6 points of damage. Half this damage is piercing damage, but the other half is from negative energy and is not subject to resistance or immunity (unless the opponent is resistant or immune to negative energy effects). An affected creature that succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save reduces the piercing damage by half. Undead within the area of a necrocone heal a number of hit points equal to the amount of negative energy damage (3d6) the attack would otherwise deal. An undead creature cannot gain temporary or bonus hit points from a mortuary cyclone's necrocone. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Unholy Grace (Su) A mortuary cyclone adds its Charisma modifier as a bonus on its saving throws and as a profane bonus to its Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these bonuses.)

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Attach (Ex) When a giant mosquito hits with a touch attack, it uses its legs to latch onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached giant mosquito is effectively grappling its prey. The giant mosquito loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh.  A giant mosquito has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached.  An attached giant mosquito can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the giant mosquito is removed.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blood Drain (Ex) A giant mosquito drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to a foe, inflicting 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Once a giant mosquito has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies away to digest its meal. If its victim dies before the giant mosquito's appetite has been sated, the giant mosquito detaches and seeks a new target.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Welt (Ex) The bite of a giant mosquito forms an irritating welt on the affected area that imposes a -2 conditional modifier to skill checks for one day if the opponent fails a DC 10 Fortitude save. A DC 10 Heal check or any cure spell negates the penalty. Both the save DC and check DC are Constitution-based.

Blinding Spray (Ex) By filling its mouth with muddy water, a muckdweller can fire a stream of muddy water in a 10-foot line. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 10 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. A muckdweller can take a move action to refill its mouth with muddy water so it can use its spray again.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acid (Ex) A mudbog secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material, but not metal or stone. Any melee hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a mudbog dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. The mudbog's acidic touch deals 17 points of acid damage per round to wooden objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) The consistency and coloration of a mudbog makes it difficult to discern from a normal patch of mud. Any creature within 10 feet of a mudbog must make a DC 20 Perception or Survival check to determine the actual nature of the creature.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Engulf (Ex) A Medium or smaller opponent that walks into a mudbog is automatically grappled and takes 1d6 acid damage each round the mudbog maintains the hold.  Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled and are trapped within the mudbog's body. This ability otherwise functions as swallow whole, save that a creature that cut its way out of a mudbog leaves no hole in the protoplas creature's body.

concentration check. It's a DC 20 Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased
in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of create water) is used to wash it away.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mud Pool (Su) A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is staggered.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ RRR	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:
A mudman's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Engulf (Su) Once per minute as a standard action, a mudman can hurl itself at any creature of its size or smaller within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is staggered for 1 round. If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can attempt a new CMB check to maintain the "hold" on the creature each round that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Magic Vulnerability (Ex) Mudmen are particularly susceptible to dispel magic, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Mud Bomb (Su) A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Curse of the Deep (Su) On a successful grapple check against a creature up to its size, a mummy of the deep presses its lips against an opponent's and regurgitates sea water into the opponent's lungs.  Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Holding one's breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal spell, or successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:

Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that mummy of the deep's despair ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Eye Rake (Ex) If a murder crow hits an opponent with both claws in the same round, the victim must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or be blinded as the crow scratches and tears at the victim's eyes. The blindness last for 1d4 days while the eyes naturally heal, or until healed (with remove blindness or a successful DC 15 Heal check). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Despondent Wail (Su) As a standard action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness. A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is permanent, though a remove curse or break enchantment (both requiring a successful caster level check against DC 18) or a limited wish, wish, or miracle can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by a murderborn's despondent wail for the next 24 hours.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Sense Living (Su): A murder-born can detect living creatures to a range of 100 feet. This functions as a detect evil spell (caster level 8th) except it detects the presence of life rather than a particular alignment. There is no chance the murder-born to be stunned and it is not blocked by stone, wood, or any other material.
