
FALSE SPIDERS
False spiders are spiderlike creatures that are very aggressive and highly
predatory in nature, often hunting at night when the element of surprise is
theirs to be had. False spiders dwell in shallow burrows which the dig with
their massive pincers. There are two kinds of false spiders: pedipalps and
solifugids.

False spiders are highly territorial and are likely to attack any living
creature that enters their area.

Poisonous Pedipalp
DESC:A rare variety of the common pedipalp exists. Rarely encountered, the
poisonous pedipalp is a solitary creature. No more than one has ever been
encountered at a given time. They do not associate with others of their
kind or with normal pedipalps. The poisonous pedipalp uses the same
statistics as the normal pedipalp with the additions below. The poisonous
pedipalp is CR 3.

Poison Cloud (Ex) When threatened, a poisonous pedipalp releases a cloud of noxious fumes in a 20-foot radius around its body. Living creatures within the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The poisonous pedipalp can use this cloud three times per day. The save DC is Constitution-based. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the nauseated creature.  Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.

Death Speak (Su): A fen witch who knows an individual's true name can speak that name as a swift action. If the individual hears the fen witch speak its name, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or perish. If the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's death speak for 24 hours. Note that the fen witch does not need to speak a language the creature understands in order to affect it; she only needs to speak its true name. Other fen witches or creatures who hear the target's true name cannot use this ability; it only functions for the fen witch after she has used her mind probe ability on the target. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Whether the fen witch's Death Speak ability is successful or not, the target's name remains fresh in her mind for 24 hours. After that, she must use her mind probe ability again to retrieve a creature's true name.

Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Mind Probe (Su) As a full-round action, a fen witch can peer into the mind of a living creature within 60 feet in an attempt to extract the creature's true name. The target can resist the mental trespassing by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save. If the save fails, the fen witch has learned the creature's true name and can use her death speak ability. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or less and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune to this ability. Psionic creatures can use defense modes or other psionic abilities to counter this probe. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's mind probe for one day.

Fire Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fire phantom can hurl a small globe of elemental fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment). By making a successful ranged touch attack, it deals 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature hit must make a successful DC 15 Reflex save to avoid catching on fire.  The save DC is Charisma-based.

Immolation (Su) Normally used as a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a DC 20 Will save.  Even if the fire phantom survives, its flames are extinguished for 1 minute. During this time the fire phantom cannot use its fire blast ability and cannot deal fire damage with its slam attack.

Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus which covers its space and lasts for 10 minutes.  This mucus comes in two types: slimy and sticky. Slimy mucus covers three squares with the effects of a grease spell.  Sticky mucus covers the squares with the effects of a web spell. Both effects are DC 14. The saves are Constitutionbased.  Flail snails are immune to this mucus. Both types of mucus can be burned way as per the web spell.

Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts back into its shell as a swift action, increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or attack while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 ft. long, and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4 rounds, after which it cannot be used by the snail or any other creatures. While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check.

Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.

1d10 | Result
1-3 | Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to successfully cast spells.
4-6 | Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast on him.
7-9 | Spell fails; nothing happens
10 | Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning)

A flail snail has one mace-like tentacle per Hit Die. Thus, a 6 HD flail snail has 6 tentacles; an 8 HD flail snail has 8 tentacles; and a 12 HD flail snail has 12 tentacles.

Attach (Ex) If a giant flea hits with a touch attack, it uses its many legs to attach itself to the opponent's body. While attached the giant flea loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13. It gains a +12 racial bonus to CMD checks while attached. An attached flea can be struck with a weapon or removed by an opposed CMB attack to pluck it free. On a critical failure (a roll of 1) the flea's head snaps off in the victim and continues to drain blood for 1d8 more rounds.  The head can be removed with a successful DC 18 Heal check.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acid Injection (Ex) When a flumph strikes an opponent with its spikes, it injects a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of damage immediately and another 1d4 points on the round after the attack. The target can end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature grappling or swallowing the flumph takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this contact.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Stench Spray (Ex) A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foulsmelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds.  The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet - if the target fails its saving throw, it is nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 1 minute. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).

Animate Dead (Su) The electrical aura of the fogwarden can animate dead creatures within 20 feet. This is otherwise identical to an animate dead (caster level 4th). The animated creatures resemble zombies (and use their stats) and are under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not undead however, and cannot be turned or rebuked. If the fogwarden is slain or moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses dead and cannot be animated again.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ RRR	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Electricity Discharge (Su) Electricity constantly plays across a fogwarden's form. Any metal object (including metal weapons) that contacts a fogwarden's body takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Magic items receive a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage by half.  Nonmagical items and objects receive no save and automatically take full damage. A creature holding the object or weapon at the time of contact takes 3d6 points of electricity damage as well (DC 13 Reflex save for half).

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ RRR	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Gaseous Form (Ex) The fogwarden's natural form is that of fog or mist. This ability is similar to the gaseous form spell (caster level 8th), except that a fogwarden does not lose its supernatural abilities or its lightning bolt ability, and has a fly speed of 40 feet. It is immune to and cannot perform combat maneuvers.

AAA	KEY:AAA ~ RRR	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Snap and Saw (Ex) A forester's bane can saw at an opponent, dealing slashing damage, when it makes a successful grapple check. This attack deals 1d4+3 points of slashing damage per stalk. It cannot attack a pinned opponent with any stalk that has already attacked another opponent that round. A forester's bane can only attempt to grapple opponents 1 or more sizes smaller than itself. Because of its four leaves, it can grapple up to four different opponents at one time with a single grapple check. It can also attack a single opponent with more than one leaf, gaining a +2 bonus on its grapple check with each extra leaf (+13 grapple with two leaves, +15 grapple with three leaves, and +17 grapple with all four leaves).  Both leaves and stalks each have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a forester's bane's leaf or stalk does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the leaf is currently grappling a target, the forester's bane takes a -4 penalty on its opposed roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a leaf or stalk deals no damage to a forester's bane. Attacks that hit a leaf deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.  Destroyed leaves and stalks grow back in 2d4 weeks if the forester's bane is not killed.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Aura of Despair (Su) A fye continually emanates an aura of despair in a 10-foot radius. Any creature within or entering this area must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability and skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for as long as they remain within the area. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the aura of despair of that fye for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Possession (Su) Once per round by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a fye can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the possession by succeeding on a DC 15 Will save. If the save fails, the fye disappears and enters the target's body. The save DC is Charisma-based.

AAA	KEY:RRR ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RRRRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Weapon Attunement (Su) Fyrs have a mystical ability to attune themselves with any weapon they wield. A weapon held by a fyr functions as a masterwork item (gaining a +1 bonus to attack rolls) as long as the fyr wields it. This bonus does not stack with the enhancement bonus gained from magical weapons, or the bonus gained from a masterwork weapon. This bonus is included in the statistics block above.
