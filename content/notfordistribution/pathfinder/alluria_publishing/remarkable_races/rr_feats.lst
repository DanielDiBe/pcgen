save. This effect is used as an immediate action after
the first save is attempted, but before the results are

subrace as you are, and one that you are familiar
with. For example, a canine anumus can become any
animal type of dog or wolf that the character has
encountered. Changing form (to animal or back) is a
standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of
opportunity.

both hands occupied. If you decide to use all four

and CMD for grapple checks use your character level
in place of your base attack bonus, with a +2
competence bonus. All other rules for grapple
maneuvers still apply.

MATRON (METAMORPHOSIS)
You metamorphosis into an entobian queen.
Prerequisites: Larvite, Prepare for

maneuverability of both feats. Of the six ability
modifiers, choose two positive ability modifiers
and one negative ability modifier to apply to your ability
scores (you cannot choose any two modifiers that affect
the same ability). You also gain either low-light vision or
darkvision if either is available through the feats you
selected. Then choose two traits from the remaining traits
available from each of your chosen metamorphosis feats,
and apply them to your character. In addition, you grow
to Medium size, and your midleg damage increases to
1d6. Optionally, you may blend larvite statistics (treat as
a metamorphosis feat and keep the spin silk racial trait)
with one metamorphosis feat. There are 10 possibilities!
Form may be patterned somewhat after an insect that
looks similar to the blended form. For example, a
Farfalite/Moscanite combination looks much like a
dragonfly, and the form can have minor physical
alterations to appear as such. The Farfalite/Moscanite
could have +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma,
Fly 40 (good), low-light vision, spell-like ability
(displacement) and spell-like ability (acid arrow).

wear decorative stones (for no armor effect) with one
armor gem to gain the racial power with no armor
bonus or penalties.
MONEY IS POWER
By consuming gold, you can become stronger, quicker,
or healthier.
Prerequisite: Numistian.
Benefit: As a standard action once per day,
you may consume 100 gold pieces to add a +4
