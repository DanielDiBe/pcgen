Bound Vermin		KEY:Vermin Rider ~ Bound Vermin	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You and your mount are under the permanent effects of mindlink.  While bound to each other, the mount gains the same energy resistances as those of you from your chitin.	SOURCEPAGE:p.315
Energized Mount		KEY:Vermin Rider ~ Energized Mount	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can expend your psionic focus as a swift action to allow your mount to deal an additional +1d6 points of energy damage with its natural attacks until the end of your next turn.  The energy type is that of the energy type for your chitin.	SOURCEPAGE:p.315
Eternal Bond		KEY:Vermin Rider ~ Eternal Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Your life becomes linked to your mount's. As long as the mount is alive, you are protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce you to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to the mount. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the mount is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with you. Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, or imprisonment, or other effect that do not cause actual damage.	SOURCEPAGE:p.315
