Abhorrent Blight				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3						SCHOOL:Necromancy													COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature															DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:With necromantic energies you attack the bond between a living soul and its body which also damages its driving force of will. The target creature suffers 1d6 hit points/ level (maximum 10d6) and 1 point/2 levels of Charisma damage (maximum 5). Upon a successful save the target suffers only half the hit point damage and negates the Charisma damage.

Accelerate Decay				CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature/level																DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will Partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:This spell only affects corporeal undead creatures and creatures kept artificially young through magic. This spell accelerates the creatures’ rot back to where a body would be ruined. The damage to undead creatures and creatures that are kept artificially young through magic (such as a potion of youth) is 1d6 points per level (to a maximum of 10d6). Particularly ancient creatures such as vampires take double damage. Mummies get +4 to their Will saves and take only half damage due to their initial preservation techniques when buried. Fast healing possessed by undead creatures is suppressed for 24 hours. If an undead creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles into a pile of dust. A successful save results in half damage and negates all other effects. The spell does not affect artificial constructs unless those constructs are made of corpses, like flesh golems. These creatures also get a Will save. If the construct is reduced to 0 hit points or less it falls apart and is destroyed.																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p. 35
Accursed Rot				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9				SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Evil			COMPS:V, S, M, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One creature																	DURATION:Permanent/Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None see text					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:This spell infects both a powerful curse and a horrible rotting disease.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p. 35
Acid Spit					CLASSES:Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Acid			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature																	DURATION:3 rounds									SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:When you cast this spell, you spit acid in the face of one creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 10d6). If the target has eyes and is not somehow protected, the spell also blinds the target. A successful saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. On the second round, the spell deals half its original damage, and on the third round it deals half that again (the damage in the second and third rounds is further reduced if the target made its save). If a target of this spell spends a full round washing the affected area in water (or similar liquid) the spell (including blindness) will be negated.

Adamantine Bonds				CLASSES:Druid,Summoner,Witch=6						SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation			DESCRIPTOR:Earth			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Any creature																	DURATION:1 day/level or until discharged					SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:This spell causes a cord made of magically hardened adamantine to come into being and wrap around the target creature, immobilizing it, causing the creature to suffer the pinned condition. Creatures that make their saving throw gain the entangled condition instead. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check (DC equal to 10 plus your caster level plus your relevant caster ability modifier). Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. Once a creature breaks free, the spell is discharged. The bonds cannot be damaged, broken, ruined, or even disintegrated; they are considered an attended object and will even teleport with the victim. Another creature can aid another in breaking the bonds.																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p. 36
Adjust					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=1					SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One unattended suit of armor, set of clothing, jewelry, shield, or weapon						DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:Adjust instantaneously resizes an unattended piece of clothing or jewelry, a suit of armor, a shield or a weapon to fit you perfectly. This spell affects both magical and mundane equipment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p. 36
Agony Unseen				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7							SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation								COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Invisible cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high										DURATION:1 minute/level								SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial see text			SPELLRES:No					DESC:An invisible bank of acidic and toxic gases billows out from the point you designate. Those exposed to the cloud suffer severe and painful blisters all over their bodies and inside their lungs, suffering wracking pains that impose a –4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. In addition, the subject is nauseated and suffers 1d6 bleed damage each round. These effects last for 1 hour. A successful saving throw reduces the nauseated condition to sickened, reduces the bleed damage by half, and reduces the circumstance penalty to -2. Constructs, undead, and creatures immune to both poison and acid are immune to this spell. Creatures immune to only one of these effects, or resistant to both, receive only a +4 bonus to their saving throw. The wracking pains and conditions inflicted this spell can only be negated by a 6th level or higher conjuration (healing) spell. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gases in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gases in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p. 36
Aid Item					CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6				SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One magically enchanted item														DURATION:1 hour									SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell temporarily adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don’t know the item’s abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activate as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item’s normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires. It the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p. 36
Aid Item (Greater)			CLASSES:Druid,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=9					SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One magically enchanted item														DURATION:1 hour or until discharged						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell temporarily grants the item your caster level, and the DC of one of its effects becomes 20+ your relevant caster ability modifier. It also adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don’t know the item’s abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, and if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activated as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item’s normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires or it is discharged. Once the item has been used three times the spell is discharged. If the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p. 36-37
Air and Water				CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5				SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Air|Water		COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature, object, or point in space touched											DURATION:1 hour/level (D)							SAVEINFO:Will negates see text			SPELLRES:See text				DESC:You create a 15-foot-radius emanation centered on the target, which can move if placed on a creature or a movable object. The emanation acts on both air and water, creating an area where the two mix in roughly equal portions. Water within the emanation becomes suffused with bubbles of air, creating an area where air-breathing creatures can breathe normally, while air within the emanation becomes a very wet mist where water-breathing creatures can breathe normally. The spell does not affect any contaminants that may be suspended in the affected air or water, such as poison gases, silt, or smoke. Likewise, the spell does not function in a vacuum, nor will it affect any magical liquid or any nonmagical liquid that is not at least 75 percent water. Underwater, the emanation creates an environment that functions partly as a land area and partly as a water area.																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p. 37
Airsphere					CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=3								SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation								COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:30-foot-radius spread	TARGETAREA:Creature or object touched								DURATION:1 minute/level								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			DESC:This spell creates a sphere of fresh air around the individual or object touched by the caster. Gaseous and vaporous attacks are unable to penetrate this airsphere, and acids or other liquids simply wash over it. The spell generates oxygen, enabling you to breathe underwater or in other areas with no fresh air (though as the sphere surrounds its recipient or object, it hampers movement in or under water). This spell doesn’t protect against natural or magical effects occurring within the airsphere: for example, if a vial of acid is thrown into the sphere, it enters; if it breaks, its contents splash for their normal effects. This spell was specially crafted to guard against dragon breath; it will absorb and negate any breath weapon (for those within the sphere) upon contact but is itself destroyed, instantly and harmlessly, in doing so.																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p. 37
Alter Liquid				CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Water			COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to 1 pint of nonmagical liquid/level (maximum 5 pints) individual volumes within 30 feet of each other	DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:This spell transmutes one kind of nonmagical liquid into another. The liquid you affect must normally be liquid at about room temperature (65degrees Farenhite), you must have line of effect to it, and you can alter liquids in open containers, but not in sealed containers. You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum volume is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater volume than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 1st-level caster (1 pint maximum) could not affect any of the liquid in a full 1-gallon container. The spell can transmute any type of mundane liquid (including fresh or salt water, wine, vinegar, alcohol, or lamp oil) but cannot affect or create acid, mercury, or any type of venom or poison. Transmuted liquids created by the spell have typical characteristics such as color, taste, smell, and potency. For example, if you turn water to ale, you get typical ale rather than any extra-strong or distinctive variety.																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p. 37-38
Alter Metal					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5							SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Earth			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to 1 lb. of metal objects/level (maximum 20 lb.) all within 30 feet of each other					DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:This spell transmutes one kind of metal into another. The metal you affect (both in its original and transmuted forms) must be solid at room temperature (so that neither mercury nor molten iron can be altered, for example). You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum weight is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater weight than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 9th-level caster (9 lb. maximum) could transmute 450 coins in a pile of 500, but could not affect 9 lb. of metal in a 10-lb. ingot. This spell can transmute any type of mundane metal or alloy (including brass, lead, bronze, iron, copper, and silver) but cannot affect or create gold, platinum, adamantine, mithral, alchemical silver, or cold iron. Weapons and armor become less effective if transmuted into softer metal (steel to copper, for example), with weapons taking a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls and armor losing 1 point of armor bonus. Weapons softened by this spell bend and gain the broken condition on any attack roll of 1. Armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck by a natural attack roll of 20, upon reaching an armor bonus of zero it gains the broken condition. Unattended, nonmagical items receive no saving throw against this spell, while nonmagical items in a creature’s possession use the wielder’s Will save bonus. Magic items use their own Will save bonus or their wielder’s, whichever is higher. Metal creatures and intelligent metal magic items are not affected by this spell. A successful Appraise or Spellcraft check (DC 15) reveals this spell’s effect on an item.																				SOURCEPAGE:p. 38
Alter Poison Damage Type		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1						SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One dose of non-magical poison that deals ability damage									DURATION:1 minute/level								SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:You are able to change the type of ability damage dealt by the affected poison. Poison that deals Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage may only be altered to one of the other two types. Poison that deals Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage may only be altered to one of the other two types. When the spell ends, the poison reverts to its normal damage type. A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison.																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p. 38		
Alter Range					CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=4				SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long		TARGETAREA:One ranged weapon/level or 50 missiles/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart			DURATION:10 minutes/level							SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:You can either enhance the range of ranged weapons by doubling their range increment, or reduce their range increment by one-half. Constructs are allowed a Will save to resist the effects of this spell on their built-in weapons, and other creatures are allowed a save to resist for weapons they carry.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p. 38
Alter Taste					CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=0					SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer									COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:One meal of 1 cu. ft./level														DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			DESC:This spell changes the taste of one meal to a taste that is pleasant for the creature consuming it. Note that this spell only disguises the taste of the meal and does not alter any other quality of it. While it will alter the taste of rotten meat, for instance, the meat will still be rotten. Furthermore, all parts of the meal taste the same no matter what is eaten. Thus soup, salad, main course, dinner roll and so on will all taste exactly alike since the spell masks any and all flavors with the taste. Each creature that tastes the meal will experience a different taste sensation depending on what his or her preference is. Thus, one creature might taste warm bread while another tastes raw meat. This spell changes the taste of anything that is part of the meal at the time the spell is cast; if something is added later, such as gravy or poison, then the spell cannot alter that and the creature receives the proper taste of the added item. Creatures are instantly aware of this spell’s effect upon the first bite and can choose to disbelieve the spell’s effects at any time.																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p. 38-39
Amber Globes				CLASSES:Druid=3|Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation			DESCRIPTOR:Electricity		COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One globe of electricity energy/2 levels												DURATION:10 minutes/level or until expended				SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half see text		SPELLRES:No					DESC:You create up to five globes of electricity energy about the size of acorns, which can be hurled at targets by you or another creature, or can be detonated on command. Each globe is capable of dealing 2d6 points of electricity damage; you can hurl them singly or as multiple attacks. Each globe is a splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet that requires a ranged touch attack to hit. Throwing a single globe is an attack action (that can be made as part of casting the spell), while throwing all the globes at a single target is a standard action (or a full round action made as part of casting the spell). Globes not thrown during the round in which you cast the spell can be held for throwing in a subsequent round, or can be handed to other characters as a standard action. Each globe explodes upon striking any hard surface, and in addition to dealing its regular electricity damage to the target, deals 2 points of splash damage (also electricity damage) per globe in all adjacent squares. Creatures within the splash area that make a successful Reflex save take only half the splash damage, but creatures struck directly are not allowed a saving throw against the globe’s primary damage. Alternatively, you can gently toss or place a globe within 5 feet of you so that it does not explode on contact. Once in place, you can cause one or more globes to detonate by speaking a command word as a standard action if you are within 200 feet. When it detonates, the globe deals its electricity damage to all targets within a 5-foot burst. Creatures in the area that make a successful Reflex save take only half damage.																													SOURCEPAGE:p. 39
Analyze Malady				CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7					SCHOOL:Divination													COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One object or creature per caster level												DURATION:1 round/level (D)							SAVEINFO:None or Will negates see text		SPELLRES:No					DESC:You discern all curses, afflictions, and detrimental effects present in a number of creatures or objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object and learn, as a free action, how to dispel, remove or negate these effects. In the case of a magic item or artifact, you also learn how to destroy the object. In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze malady spells for 24 hours.																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p. 39
Anathema					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6							SCHOOL:Abjuration													COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:10-ft./level radius emanation from caster												DURATION:10 minutes/level							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:The spell charges the area around you with arcane energy of a sort that the gods themselves find most unpleasant. This form of energy also interferes with the prayers of the faithful, making it more difficult for divine words of power to be invoked. Divine spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50 percent for any divine spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on divine spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on divine spells that were already cast before the caster entered the anathema area of effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p. 39
Anger of the Spirit			CLASSES:Druid,Witch=8								SCHOOL:Necromancy													COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature															DURATION:Permanent								SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:You call upon all the spirits of nature, wracking the target with a horrid fate. First, the target must roll twice for every initiative, attack, ability check, skill check, and saving throw, taking the lower of the two rolls. Second, the spirits torment him, causing an additional effect based on your choice: Roll twice for SR as well. Roll twice for damage each time the target hits, taking the lower damage total. Roll twice on all spell-related effects. Roll twice for all percentile rolls (miss chance, stabilization, fortification). Roll three times (rather than twice) for initiative. Target cannot refocus or delay. One special ability with a duration has its duration halved. Any positive effect of the special ability is halved, and any negative effect is doubled. Carrying capacity is halved. Decrease speed –5 ft. if wearing armor. Take double damage from all energy attacks. This spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a remove curse, limited wish, miracle or wish. A remove curse or limited wish only grants a second saving throw; if that save is unsuccessful, those spells have no further effect.																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p. 39-40
Angry Wound					CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Evil			COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Living creature touched															DURATION:1 round/level (D) see text						SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:Upon concluding the dreadful incantation, you become fueled with awful power; your touch causes flesh to burst and weep freely. With a touch, you open an ugly wound on a living creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage (no save). Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage as its flesh bursts and suppurates. If the target succeeds on two consecutive saves, the effect ends.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animal Mind					CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Ranger=3|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion|Mind-Affecting						COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature with Intelligence 2 or greater											DURATION:1 hour/level								SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:Choose an animal type when you cast this spell. The subject believes it is an animal of that type. If the subject does not know how such an animal would act, it acts in a manner that it believes an animal should act. While affected by this spell, spells and abilities that target animals will also affect the subject. Any attempt to interact with the subject requires a Handle Animal check (DC 10+ your caster level).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animate Element				CLASSES:Druid,Summoner=1							SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One small volume of an element														DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:The caster animates a small section of air, earth, fire, or water. The animated element has the statistics of a Small elemental (see Pathfinder BestiaryTM), and attacks as directed by the caster. It cannot move beyond the range of the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animate Skeleton				CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=1						SCHOOL:Necromancy													COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One corpse or skeleton															DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell turns the body or bones of a person or creature into a skeleton. This spell will only animate dead creatures of Medium size or smaller. The skeleton can follow the caster and obey the caster’s commands or can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place. The skeleton remains animated until it is destroyed. A destroyed skeleton cannot be reanimated again. Regardless of the number of times this spell is cast, only a single skeleton from this spell may be controlled at any one time by a single caster. If another skeleton is animated using this spell while another is already under your control, the original becomes uncontrolled. This undead does not count against your HD limit of controlled undead. An undead skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton or corpse. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animate Tattoo				CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow									COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:A 3-inch-square area of flesh														DURATION:Permanent								SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:See text				DESC:You create a tattoo upon your own body that has the ability to move and attack (using your base attack bonus plus the relevant casting ability modifier) out to a range equal to your natural reach. Moving the tattoo around your body is not an action. Attacking with the tattoo is a melee attack action (it can be used to make attacks of opportunity). The tattoo deals damage equal to 1d6 plus the relevant casting ability modifier (successfully disbelieving after interacting with the tattoo reduces the damage by half). The spell can create an animated tattoo of a lion roaring or a dragon breathing fire, a moving waterfall, or a warrior swinging a sword. The image and its movements are preset; once the spell is cast, you cannot change them. The tattoo can move all over your body if you wish.																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animate Tools				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=0		SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One tool or one set of related tools													DURATION:8 hours									SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object) Spell	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	DESC:The spell causes a tool or a group of tools used together to perform a task to animate and perform a task you designate. These tools follow your directions to the best of their abilities, but can only be used for their intended purpose. This spell allows you to complete an amount of work equivalent to a single person working for eight hours. The tools use your Craft or Profession check as appropriate. The tools may aid another. There are many other common uses of this spell that require no check, such as commanding a broom to sweep the floor or a shovel to dig a trench. Only mundane tasks can be accomplished with this spell. It has no effect on crafting magic items. Under no circumstance can tools be used to attack a creature, though items can damage a structure if that is their intended purpose (such as a pick or an axe).																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p. 40-41
Animate Wood				CLASSES:Druid=1									SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One Small or smaller wooden object													DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell imbues a Small or smaller wooden object as an animated object (see Pathfinder BestiaryTM), then causes it to immediately attack whomever or whatever you initially designate. Objects animated by this spell have hardness 5. If you attempt to affect an attended object, the object or its attendee receives a Will save and spell resistance applies.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p. 41
Antagonize Wound				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=0				SCHOOL:Necromancy													COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Living creature touched															DURATION:1 round/level (D) see text						SAVEINFO:Fort negates					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:With a touch, you cause an existing wound to deal 1 point of damage. Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1 point of damage. If the target succeeds on two consecutive saves or is subjected to a Conjuration (healing) spell, the effect ends.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p. 41
Arboreal Archer				CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=2								SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One living tree or shrub see text													DURATION:Concentration + 2 rounds, up to 1 minute/ level (D)	SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:You imbue limited intelligence to one non-sentient tree or shrub no less than 20 feet tall, allowing you to telepathically communicate simple instructions to the tree. On your command, the tree pulls back its branches and fires a volley of acorns, branches, or other debris at any target that you designate. The tree receives one ranged attack per round and its BAB equals your caster level plus your Dexterity modifier. Its attack deals 1d4 points of damage plus one point of damage per three caster levels and has a range increment of 30 feet. The tree is immobile, has an AC of 16, and30 hit points. The tree is incapable of defending itself; it only attacks when directed. The spell ends two rounds after you cease concentration or the tree sustains 30 or more points of damage.																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p. 41
Arcane Prohibition			CLASSES:Cleric,Inquisitor,Witch=6						SCHOOL:Abjuration													COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:10-ft./level radius emanation from caster												DURATION:10 minutes/level							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:You imbue the surrounding area with such a strong divine presence that arcane magics have difficulty functioning properly. The air seems to crackle slightly, the way it does just before a major storm, and everything within the barrier appears to glitter as if coated with gold dust. Spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50 percent for any arcane spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on arcane spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on arcane spells that were already cast before the caster entered the arcane prohibition area of effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p. 41
Arcane Seal (Lesser/Acid)		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Abjuration													COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 minute			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One magic seal placed on an object													DURATION:Permanent until discharged (D)					SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half				SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:You create a magical seal that bears your visible arcane mark (and though you do not have to cast arcane mark to cast lesser arcane seal, it must be a spell you know). The seal you create resembles the wax seal one sees on letters and documents, and can range from 1 to 6 inches across. A lesser arcane seal is exceedingly tough, having a hardness of 10, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 25. When placed on a door or other closure (a chest, window, and so forth), the lesser arcane seal grants the portal its break DC or adds +5 to the portal’s existing break DC (whichever is higher). The seal is unaffected by knock spells unless the caster makes a caster level check (DC 12 + your caster level). A rogue or other character with the trapfinding class feature can break the seal with a DC 27 Disable Device check. At your option, you can also imbue the seal with magical energy so that any creature breaking it takes1d8 points, plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +5), of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. When you add a damaging effect to the seal, you must add additional runes to the seal. Anyone can read these runes and discover the seal’s effect with a DC 12 Spellcraft check. You can disable a lesser arcane seal simply by touching it and using a standard action to dismiss the spell. At the time you create the seal, you can specify a password or phrase that allows other creatures to break the seal with no difficulty, and without triggering any damaging effects. Acid: A lesser acid seal leaves a patch of acid on the victim if it fails a Reflex save, dealing 1 point of continuing acid damage each round for 1d4 rounds. The affected creature can make another Reflex save as a full-round action to neutralize the acid (assuming no other means to do so is available).	SOURCEPAGE:p. 41-42

She sheds bright light to a radius of 30 feet and shadowy light an additional 30 feet beyond that. Looking directly at the target creature is difficult, granting concealment to the target (20 percent miss chance) and dazzling anybody who looks directly at the target for 1d6 rounds (Will negates). If a creature looks at the target more than once, she will be re-dazzled. The durations of the dazzle effects do not stack but are renewed whenever the creature becomes re-dazzled. The armor of light also provides a +1 deflection bonus to AC per four caster levels (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).

Armor of Thorns				CLASSES:Alchemist,Druid,Ranger=4						SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation								COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:1 minute/level (D)																					DESC:For the duration of the spell, your torso grows a weave of green, writhing thorns. Creatures striking you with natural weapons or hand-held weapons take 7 points of piercing damage each time they hit you. In addition, the thorns grant the caster a +4 natural armor bonus. The caster may will the thorns to move out of the way so he may safely receive beneficial touch-based spells and spell-like effects. As a full-round action (does not provoke attacks of opportunity), the caster can have the vines strike out from his body, dealing 4d4 points of damage to all creatures within a 5-foot-long, 180-degree arc in front of him, or to all creatures within 5 feet of him (Reflex save for half damage).

Armor of Thorns and Vines		CLASSES:Druid=7									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation								COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You																		DURATION:1 minute/level (D)																					DESC:For the duration of the spell, your torso grows a weave of green, writhing thorny vines. Creatures striking you with natural weapons or hand-held weapons take 2d12 points of piercing damage each time they hit you. Once per round you make a grapple check (caster level plus relevant caster ability modifier) against such an attacker; while grappled, that creature suffers this damage each round. In addition, the thorns grant the caster a +8 natural armor bonus. The caster may will the thorny vines to move out of the way so he may safely receive beneficial touch-based spells and spell-like effects. As a full-round action (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity), the caster can have the vines strike out from his body, dealing 4d12 points of damage to all creatures within a 15-foot-long, 180-degree arc in front of him, or to all creatures within 10 feet of him (Reflex save for half damage).

The metal plates are the material focus of the spell, and grant both a +5 armor bonus and damage reduction 5/adamantine. Due to the nature of the metal actually merging with the caster’s skin, no armor check penalties or the like are inflicted by the temporary armor. After the duration of the spell has expired, the armor plates simply drop off. This is a common spell amongst the priesthood of mechanist sects.

(If any targeted skeleton happens to be unwilling, it may attempt a Will save to negate being affected by the spell.) When any target skeleton is destroyed (or at the end of the duration of army of shards), it detonates causing 1d10 piercing damage, +1 force damage/caster level (maximum of 1d10 + 10) to everything within 25 feet. Against this detonation, all targets may attempt a Reflex save for half damage.

Creatures that make their saving throws take half damage and negate the pinned condition; creatures with cover automatically negate the pinned condition, take no damage on a successful save, and half damage if they fail their save.

If this spell would raise the target’s base attack bonus to 21 or more, it receives a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, but gains no benefit for having a base attack bonus higher than +20. You don’t possess this additional base attack bonus for the purpose of prerequisites.

Augment Poison				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Transmutation												COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One non-magical poison dose/3 levels													DURATION:10 minutes/level							SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object) Spell	SPELLRES:yes (harmless, object)	DESC:This spell makes poison more potent and toxic. Any dose of poison affected by the spell has its Fortitude DC changed to (10 + 1/2 caster level + spellcasting ability modifier). Furthermore, any ability damage caused by the poison does one additional point of damage each round and its duration is increased by 1 round. For example, if you had one dose of standard wyvern poison; injury; save DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; and it were augmented by a 11th-level wizard with a Intelligence score of 22, it would become augmented wyvern poison injury; save DC 21; frequency 1/round for 7 rounds; effect 1d4+1 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; If the duration of the spell expires, the augmented effect ends immediately. Thus, if a person has suffered 6 rounds of the augmented wyvern poison and the spell ends before the 7th round it would not deal damage on the seventh round. This spell only affects discrete doses of poison, though they may already be placed on a weapon, trap, or other item. Thus, if the spell were cast on a 10-gallon vat of wyvern poison, it would have no effect. A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison and does radiate magic.

Creatures within the area who fail their save cannot take any offensive action. If attacked, they will defend themselves with the total defense maneuver. Creatures who make their save suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on all attack and damage rolls. Casting spells of a destructive nature from within the area requires a Concentration check (DC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier). All cowering, frightened, panicked, and shaken conditions are suppressed while within the affected area of aura of peace.
