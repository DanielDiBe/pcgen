Abhorrent Blight				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3						SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One living creature																															DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:With necromantic energies you attack the bond between a living soul and its body which also damages its driving force of will. The target creature suffers 1d6 hit points/ level (maximum 10d6) and 1 point/2 levels of Charisma damage (maximum 5). Upon a successful save the target suffers only half the hit point damage and negates the Charisma damage.

Accelerate Decay				CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) creature																															DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will Partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:This spell only affects corporeal undead creatures and creatures kept artificially young through magic. This spell accelerates the creatures' rot back to where a body would be ruined. The damage to undead creatures and creatures that are kept artificially young through magic (such as a potion of youth) is 1d6 points per level (to a maximum of 10d6). Particularly ancient creatures such as vampires take double damage. Mummies get +4 to their Will saves and take only half damage due to their initial preservation techniques when buried. Fast healing possessed by undead creatures is suppressed for 24 hours. If an undead creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles into a pile of dust. A successful save results in half damage and negates all other effects. The spell does not affect artificial constructs unless those constructs are made of corpses, like flesh golems. These creatures also get a Will save. If the construct is reduced to 0 hit points or less it falls apart and is destroyed.

Accursed Rot				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9				SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Evil				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:One creature																																	DURATION:Permanent/Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:None see text					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:This spell infects both a powerful curse and a horrible rotting disease.

Acid Spit					CLASSES:Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Acid				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One creature																																	DURATION:3 rounds											SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:When you cast this spell, you spit acid in the face of one creature, dealing (CASTERLEVEL)d6 points of damage per level (maximum 10d6). If the target has eyes and is not somehow protected, the spell also blinds the target. A successful saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. On the second round, the spell deals half its original damage, and on the third round it deals half that again (the damage in the second and third rounds is further reduced if the target made its save). If a target of this spell spends a full round washing the affected area in water (or similar liquid) the spell (including blindness) will be negated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p. 35-36
Adamantine Bonds				CLASSES:Druid,Summoner,Witch=6						SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation			DESCRIPTOR:Earth				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:Any creature																																	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days or until discharged						SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:This spell causes a cord made of magically hardened adamantine to come into being and wrap around the target creature, immobilizing it, causing the creature to suffer the pinned condition. Creatures that make their saving throw gain the entangled condition instead. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check (DC equal to (10+(CASTERLEVEL)+PELLSTAT) plus your relevant caster ability modifier). Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. Once a creature breaks free, the spell is discharged. The bonds cannot be damaged, broken, ruined, or even disintegrated; they are considered an attended object and will even teleport with the victim. Another creature can aid another in breaking the bonds.

Adjust					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=1					SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:One unattended suit of armor, set of clothing, jewelry, shield, or weapon																						DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:Adjust instantaneously resizes an unattended piece of clothing or jewelry, a suit of armor, a shield or a weapon to fit you perfectly. This spell affects both magical and mundane equipment.

Agony Unseen				CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7							SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation									TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:Invisible cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high																										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes								SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial see text			SPELLRES:No					DESC:An invisible bank of acidic and toxic gases billows out from the point you designate. Those exposed to the cloud suffer severe and painful blisters all over their bodies and inside their lungs, suffering wracking pains that impose a –4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. In addition, the subject is nauseated and suffers 1d6 bleed damage each round. These effects last for 1 hour. A successful saving throw reduces the nauseated condition to sickened, reduces the bleed damage by half, and reduces the circumstance penalty to -2. Constructs, undead, and creatures immune to both poison and acid are immune to this spell. Creatures immune to only one of these effects, or resistant to both, receive only a +4 bonus to their saving throw. The wracking pains and conditions inflicted this spell can only be negated by a 6th level or higher conjuration (healing) spell. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gases in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gases in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.

Aid Item					CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6				SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:One magically enchanted item																														DURATION:1 hour											SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell temporarily adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don't know the item's abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activate as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item's normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires. It the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p. 36
Aid Item (Greater)			CLASSES:Druid,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=9					SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:One magically enchanted item																														DURATION:1 hour or until discharged								SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell temporarily grants the item your caster level, and the DC of one of its effects becomes 20+ your relevant caster ability modifier. It also adds 3 special charges to a magic item. If 3 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as an immediate action (if you don't know the item's abilities then one ability is activated at random), if 2 charges are used then one ability of the item is activated as a move action, and if 1 charge is used then one ability of the item is activated as a standard action. These charges may be tapped into without drawing upon the item's normal reservoir of charges or uses per day. This buffer (and any unused charges) vanishes when the spell expires or it is discharged. Once the item has been used three times the spell is discharged. If the item cannot be activated by at least a standard action this spell has no effect on that item.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p. 36-37
Air and Water				CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5				SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Air|Water			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Creature, object, or point in space touched																											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hour (D)								SAVEINFO:Will negates see text			SPELLRES:See text				DESC:You create a 15-foot-radius emanation centered on the target, which can move if placed on a creature or a movable object. The emanation acts on both air and water, creating an area where the two mix in roughly equal portions. Water within the emanation becomes suffused with bubbles of air, creating an area where air-breathing creatures can breathe normally, while air within the emanation becomes a very wet mist where water-breathing creatures can breathe normally. The spell does not affect any contaminants that may be suspended in the affected air or water, such as poison gases, silt, or smoke. Likewise, the spell does not function in a vacuum, nor will it affect any magical liquid or any nonmagical liquid that is not at least 75 percent water. Underwater, the emanation creates an environment that functions partly as a land area and partly as a water area.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p. 37
Airsphere					CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=3								SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation									TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:30-foot-radius spread, Creature or object touched																										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minute									SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			DESC:This spell creates a sphere of fresh air around the individual or object touched by the caster. Gaseous and vaporous attacks are unable to penetrate this airsphere, and acids or other liquids simply wash over it. The spell generates oxygen, enabling you to breathe underwater or in other areas with no fresh air (though as the sphere surrounds its recipient or object, it hampers movement in or under water). This spell doesn't protect against natural or magical effects occurring within the airsphere: for example, if a vial of acid is thrown into the sphere, it enters; if it breaks, its contents splash for their normal effects. This spell was specially crafted to guard against dragon breath; it will absorb and negate any breath weapon (for those within the sphere) upon contact but is itself destroyed, instantly and harmlessly, in doing so.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p. 37
Alter Liquid				CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Water				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:Up to 1 pint of nonmagical liquid/level (maximum 5 pints) individual volumes within 30 feet of each other																	DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:This spell transmutes one kind of nonmagical liquid into another. The liquid you affect must normally be liquid at about room temperature (65degrees Farenhite), you must have line of effect to it, and you can alter liquids in open containers, but not in sealed containers. You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum volume is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater volume than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 1st-level caster (1 pint maximum) could not affect any of the liquid in a full 1-gallon container. The spell can transmute any type of mundane liquid (including fresh or salt water, wine, vinegar, alcohol, or lamp oil) but cannot affect or create acid, mercury, or any type of venom or poison. Transmuted liquids created by the spell have typical characteristics such as color, taste, smell, and potency. For example, if you turn water to ale, you get typical ale rather than any extra-strong or distinctive variety.																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p. 37-38
Alter Metal					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5							SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Earth				TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) lbs. of metal objects (maximum 20 lb.) all within 30 feet of each other																				DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:This spell transmutes one kind of metal into another. The metal you affect (both in its original and transmuted forms) must be solid at room temperature (so that neither mercury nor molten iron can be altered, for example). You can select multiple targets for this spell so long as the maximum weight is not exceeded, but you cannot select a target with a greater weight than your limit and partially affect it. For example, a 9th-level caster (9 lb. maximum) could transmute 450 coins in a pile of 500, but could not affect 9 lb. of metal in a 10-lb. ingot. This spell can transmute any type of mundane metal or alloy (including brass, lead, bronze, iron, copper, and silver) but cannot affect or create gold, platinum, adamantine, mithral, alchemical silver, or cold iron. Weapons and armor become less effective if transmuted into softer metal (steel to copper, for example), with weapons taking a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls and armor losing 1 point of armor bonus. Weapons softened by this spell bend and gain the broken condition on any attack roll of 1. Armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck by a natural attack roll of 20, upon reaching an armor bonus of zero it gains the broken condition. Unattended, nonmagical items receive no saving throw against this spell, while nonmagical items in a creature's possession use the wielder's Will save bonus. Magic items use their own Will save bonus or their wielder's, whichever is higher. Metal creatures and intelligent metal magic items are not affected by this spell. A successful Appraise or Spellcraft check (DC 15) reveals this spell's effect on an item.																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p. 38
Alter Poison Damage Type		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1						SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One dose of non-magical poison that deals ability damage																									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes								SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:You are able to change the type of ability damage dealt by the affected poison. Poison that deals Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage may only be altered to one of the other two types. Poison that deals Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage may only be altered to one of the other two types. When the spell ends, the poison reverts to its normal damage type. A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p. 38
Alter Range					CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=4				SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long				TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) ranged weapons or ((CASTERLEVEL)*50) missiles, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart																	DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes								SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)			DESC:You can either enhance the range of ranged weapons by doubling their range increment, or reduce their range increment by one-half. Constructs are allowed a Will save to resist the effects of this spell on their built-in weapons, and other creatures are allowed a save to resist for weapons they carry.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p. 38
Alter Taste					CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=0					SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Glamer										TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:10 ft.			TARGETAREA:One meal of (CASTERLEVEL) cu. ft.																													DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			DESC:This spell changes the taste of one meal to a taste that is pleasant for the creature consuming it. Note that this spell only disguises the taste of the meal and does not alter any other quality of it. While it will alter the taste of rotten meat, for instance, the meat will still be rotten. Furthermore, all parts of the meal taste the same no matter what is eaten. Thus soup, salad, main course, dinner roll and so on will all taste exactly alike since the spell masks any and all flavors with the taste. Each creature that tastes the meal will experience a different taste sensation depending on what his or her preference is. Thus, one creature might taste warm bread while another tastes raw meat. This spell changes the taste of anything that is part of the meal at the time the spell is cast; if something is added later, such as gravy or poison, then the spell cannot alter that and the creature receives the proper taste of the added item. Creatures are instantly aware of this spell's effect upon the first bite and can choose to disbelieve the spell's effects at any time.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p. 38-39
Amber Globes				CLASSES:Druid=3|Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=2					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation			DESCRIPTOR:Electricity			TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:((CASTERLEVEL)/2) globe of electricity energy																											DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes or until expended					SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half see text		SPELLRES:No					DESC:You create up to five globes of electricity energy about the size of acorns, which can be hurled at targets by you or another creature, or can be detonated on command. Each globe is capable of dealing 2d6 points of electricity damage; you can hurl them singly or as multiple attacks. Each globe is a splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet that requires a ranged touch attack to hit. Throwing a single globe is an attack action (that can be made as part of casting the spell), while throwing all the globes at a single target is a standard action (or a full round action made as part of casting the spell). Globes not thrown during the round in which you cast the spell can be held for throwing in a subsequent round, or can be handed to other characters as a standard action. Each globe explodes upon striking any hard surface, and in addition to dealing its regular electricity damage to the target, deals 2 points of splash damage (also electricity damage) per globe in all adjacent squares. Creatures within the splash area that make a successful Reflex save take only half the splash damage, but creatures struck directly are not allowed a saving throw against the globe's primary damage. Alternatively, you can gently toss or place a globe within 5 feet of you so that it does not explode on contact. Once in place, you can cause one or more globes to detonate by speaking a command word as a standard action if you are within 200 feet. When it detonates, the globe deals its electricity damage to all targets within a 5-foot burst. Creatures in the area that make a successful Reflex save take only half damage.

Analyze Malady				CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=7					SCHOOL:Divination														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:(CASTERLEVEL) object or creature																													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)								SAVEINFO:None or Will negates see text		SPELLRES:No					DESC:You discern all curses, afflictions, and detrimental effects present in a number of creatures or objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object and learn, as a free action, how to dispel, remove or negate these effects. In the case of a magic item or artifact, you also learn how to destroy the object. In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze malady spells for 24 hours.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p. 39
Anathema					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6							SCHOOL:Abjuration														TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:10 ft.			TARGETAREA:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft. radius emanation from caster																										DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes								SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:The spell charges the area around you with arcane energy of a sort that the gods themselves find most unpleasant. This form of energy also interferes with the prayers of the faithful, making it more difficult for divine words of power to be invoked. Divine spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50 percent for any divine spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on divine spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on divine spells that were already cast before the caster entered the anathema area of effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p. 39
Anger of the Spirit			CLASSES:Druid,Witch=8								SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One living creature																															DURATION:Permanent										SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:You call upon all the spirits of nature, wracking the target with a horrid fate. First, the target must roll twice for every initiative, attack, ability check, skill check, and saving throw, taking the lower of the two rolls. Second, the spirits torment him, causing an additional effect based on your choice: Roll twice for SR as well. Roll twice for damage each time the target hits, taking the lower damage total. Roll twice on all spell-related effects. Roll twice for all percentile rolls (miss chance, stabilization, fortification). Roll three times (rather than twice) for initiative. Target cannot refocus or delay. One special ability with a duration has its duration halved. Any positive effect of the special ability is halved, and any negative effect is doubled. Carrying capacity is halved. Decrease speed –5 ft. if wearing armor. Take double damage from all energy attacks. This spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a remove curse, limited wish, miracle or wish. A remove curse or limited wish only grants a second saving throw; if that save is unsuccessful, those spells have no further effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p. 39-40
Angry Wound					CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Inquisitor,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Necromancy								DESCRIPTOR:Evil				TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D) see text						SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:Upon concluding the dreadful incantation, you become fueled with awful power; your touch causes flesh to burst and weep freely. With a touch, you open an ugly wound on a living creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage (no save). Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage as its flesh bursts and suppurates. If the target succeeds on two consecutive saves, the effect ends.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animal Mind					CLASSES:Bard,Druid,Ranger=3|Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion|Mind-Affecting							TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One creature with Intelligence 2 or greater																											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours									SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:Choose an animal type when you cast this spell. The subject believes it is an animal of that type. If the subject does not know how such an animal would act, it acts in a manner that it believes an animal should act. While affected by this spell, spells and abilities that target animals will also affect the subject. Any attempt to interact with the subject requires a Handle Animal check DC (10+(CASTERLEVEL)).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animate Element				CLASSES:Druid,Summoner=1							SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One small volume of an element																														DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:The caster animates a small section of air, earth, fire, or water. The animated element has the statistics of a Small elemental (see Pathfinder BestiaryTM), and attacks as directed by the caster. It cannot move beyond the range of the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animate Skeleton				CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=1						SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:One corpse or skeleton																															DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell turns the body or bones of a person or creature into a skeleton. This spell will only animate dead creatures of Medium size or smaller. The skeleton can follow the caster and obey the caster's commands or can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place. The skeleton remains animated until it is destroyed. A destroyed skeleton cannot be reanimated again. Regardless of the number of times this spell is cast, only a single skeleton from this spell may be controlled at any one time by a single caster. If another skeleton is animated using this spell while another is already under your control, the original becomes uncontrolled. This undead does not count against your HD limit of controlled undead. An undead skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton or corpse. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p. 40
Animate Tattoo				CLASSES:Alchemist,Bard,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow										TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:A 3-inch-square area of flesh																														DURATION:Permanent										SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:See text				DESC:You create a tattoo upon your own body that has the ability to move and attack (using your base attack bonus plus the relevant casting ability modifier) out to a range equal to your natural reach. Moving the tattoo around your body is not an action. Attacking with the tattoo is a melee attack action (it can be used to make attacks of opportunity). The tattoo deals damage equal to 1d6 plus the relevant casting ability modifier (successfully disbelieving after interacting with the tattoo reduces the damage by half). The spell can create an animated tattoo of a lion roaring or a dragon breathing fire, a moving waterfall, or a warrior swinging a sword. The image and its movements are preset; once the spell is cast, you cannot change them. The tattoo can move all over your body if you wish.

Animate Tools				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Summoner,Witch,Wizard=0		SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One tool or one set of related tools																													DURATION:8 hours											SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object) Spell	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	DESC:The spell causes a tool or a group of tools used together to perform a task to animate and perform a task you designate. These tools follow your directions to the best of their abilities, but can only be used for their intended purpose. This spell allows you to complete an amount of work equivalent to a single person working for eight hours. The tools use your Craft or Profession check as appropriate. The tools may aid another. There are many other common uses of this spell that require no check, such as commanding a broom to sweep the floor or a shovel to dig a trench. Only mundane tasks can be accomplished with this spell. It has no effect on crafting magic items. Under no circumstance can tools be used to attack a creature, though items can damage a structure if that is their intended purpose (such as a pick or an axe).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p. 40-41
Animate Wood				CLASSES:Druid=1									SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One Small or smaller wooden object																													DURATION:Concentration, up to (CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell imbues a Small or smaller wooden object as an animated object (see Pathfinder BestiaryTM), then causes it to immediately attack whomever or whatever you initially designate. Objects animated by this spell have hardness 5. If you attempt to affect an attended object, the object or its attendee receives a Will save and spell resistance applies.

Antagonize Wound				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=0				SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																															DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D) see text						SAVEINFO:Fort negates					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:With a touch, you cause an existing wound to deal 1 point of damage. Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1 point of damage. If the target succeeds on two consecutive saves or is subjected to a Conjuration (healing) spell, the effect ends.

On your command, the tree pulls back its branches and fires a volley of acorns, branches, or other debris at any target that you designate. The tree receives one ranged attack per round and its BAB equals ((CASTERLEVEL)+DEX) modifier. Its attack deals 1d4+((CASTERLEVEL)/3) points of damage and has a range increment of 30 feet. The tree is immobile, has an AC of 16, and30 hit points. The tree is incapable of defending itself; it only attacks when directed. The spell ends two rounds after you cease concentration or the tree sustains 30 or more points of damage.

The air seems to crackle slightly, the way it does just before a major storm, and everything within the barrier appears to glitter as if coated with gold dust. Spellcasters within the area suffer a spell failure chance of 50 percent for any arcane spells they cast while in this area. The spell has no further effect on arcane spells that are successfully cast within the area, or on arcane spells that were already cast before the caster entered the arcane prohibition area of effect.

The seal you create resembles the wax seal one sees on letters and documents, and can range from 1 to 6 inches across. A lesser arcane seal is exceedingly tough, having a hardness of 10, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 25. When placed on a door or other closure (a chest, window, and so forth), the lesser arcane seal grants the portal its break DC or adds +5 to the portal's existing break DC (whichever is higher). The seal is unaffected by knock spells unless the caster makes a caster level check DC (12+(CASTERLEVEL)). A rogue or other character with the trapfinding class feature can break the seal with a DC 27 Disable Device check. At your option, you can also imbue the seal with magical energy so that any creature breaking it takes1d8 points, plus ((CASTERLEVEL),5) of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. When you add a damaging effect to the seal, you must add additional runes to the seal. Anyone can read these runes and discover the seal's effect with a DC 12 Spellcraft check. You can disable a lesser arcane seal simply by touching it and using a standard action to dismiss the spell. At the time you create the seal, you can specify a password or phrase that allows other creatures to break the seal with no difficulty, and without triggering any damaging effects. Acid: A lesser acid seal leaves a patch of acid on the victim if it fails a Reflex save, dealing 1 point of continuing acid damage each round for 1d4 rounds. The affected creature can make another Reflex save as a full-round action to neutralize the acid (assuming no other means to do so is available).

She sheds bright light to a radius of 30 feet and shadowy light an additional 30 feet beyond that. Looking directly at the target creature is difficult, granting concealment to the target (20 percent miss chance) and dazzling anybody who looks directly at the target for 1d6 rounds (Will negates). If a creature looks at the target more than once, she will be re-dazzled. The durations of the dazzle effects do not stack but are renewed whenever the creature becomes re-dazzled.

The caster may will the thorns to move out of the way so he may safely receive beneficial touch-based spells and spell-like effects. As a full-round action (does not provoke attacks of opportunity), the caster can have the vines strike out from his body, dealing 4d4 points of damage to all creatures within a 5-foot-long, 180-degree arc in front of him, or to all creatures within 5 feet of him (Reflex save for half damage).

The metal plates are the material focus of the spell, and grant both a +5 armor bonus and damage reduction 5/adamantine. Due to the nature of the metal actually merging with the caster's skin, no armor check penalties or the like are inflicted by the temporary armor. After the duration of the spell has expired, the armor plates simply drop off.

If this spell would raise the target's base attack bonus to 21 or more, it receives a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, but gains no benefit for having a base attack bonus higher than +20.

Augment Poison				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:((CASTERLEVEL)/3) non-magical poison doses																												DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object) Spell	SPELLRES:yes (harmless, object)	DESC:This spell makes poison more potent and toxic. Any dose of poison affected by the spell has its Fortitude DC changed to (10+((CASTERLEVEL)/2)+SPELLSTAT). Furthermore, any ability damage caused by the poison does one additional point of damage each round and its duration is increased by 1 round. For example, if you had one dose of standard wyvern poison; injury; save DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; and it were augmented by a 11th-level wizard with a Intelligence score of 22, it would become augmented wyvern poison injury; save DC 21; frequency 1/round for 7 rounds; effect 1d4+1 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; If the duration of the spell expires, the augmented effect ends immediately. Thus, if a person has suffered 6 rounds of the augmented wyvern poison and the spell ends before the 7th round it would not deal damage on the seventh round. This spell only affects discrete doses of poison, though they may already be placed on a weapon, trap, or other item. Thus, if the spell were cast on a 10-gallon vat of wyvern poison, it would have no effect. A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison and does radiate magic.

You magically bind a curse (a spell that cannot be dispelled, such as bestow curse) to the object touched. An unwilling creature attending an object you wish to affect with this spell receives a Will save to negate this spell. When a creature is considered to be attending the object (touching it or carrying on one's person) that creature is subject to the curse. Baleful object attempts to dispel (as described in greater dispel magic) any and all spells, spell-like abilities or effects on the target that directly or indirectly interfere with the curse taking effect. For example, a character casts bestow curse onto a longsword and a subject with spell immunity (bestow curse) upon her touches the object. A dispel check is made (DC 11 + the caster level of the spell immunity). If the dispel succeeds, the spell is dispelled before the bestow curse takes effect. Baleful object's dispelling can only affect spells cast upon a creature or object. Independent spell effects or those affecting an area cannot be dispelled, even if they prevent the curse from affecting the attending creature. Baleful object can dispel spells and magic items specifically intended to foil the spell in question (spell immunity), that provide general protection from spells (spell resistance), and/or offer any bonuses to the saving throws (cloak of resistance). You make a check for each instance of protection; a magic item so affected is suppressed for 1d4+1 rounds. You are not affected by the cursed object when you cast the spell but any time you touch or attend the object after the initial casting, you are affected as normal.

The gem continues to store this energy until activated or dispelled; there is no time limit. As long as the gem remains prepared, one 8th level spell slot is unavailable to the caster. Dispelling the gem's charge has no effect on the gem and returns the spell slot (empty) to the caster. When the gem is activated (a standard action that requires only that the gem be in hand), it is destroyed, crumbling to powder. However, an area of pure magic surrounds the caster and suppresses any antimagic effects that overlap the emanation. The emanation lasts for one round per (CASTERLEVEL).

You create one sting for every three caster levels (minimum 1, maximum 6 at 18th level). Each bee sting inflicts 1 point of piercing damage, as if from a magical weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If this damage is not somehow negated (such as by damage reduction), the subject is poisoned with weak venom that inflicts 1 Con damage, with a Fortitude save allowed at the spell's DC to negate it.

The GM offers a complete and perfectly accurate answer that is in no way cryptic, but if the subject is not related to the original query, the GM is not required to reveal that information. If the caster's player ever reveals any of the details of this insight to another player, or if the caster ever reveals any of the details of this insight to another character (PC or NPC—subject to GM adjudication), the caster is destroyed as if never having existing and reality is altered so that the information relayed is in some way vitally inaccurate and the truth is far more deadly and dangerous.

Those bound are unable to leave the chosen site (a ship, a building, a dungeon complex, etc.). They may act normally, but cannot move beyond the place's confines. They can climb to the top of the building, descend into the bowels of a cellar, or shoot arrows from the porch or whatever they choose, as long as they do not leave the site. If they are forcibly removed from the site they make every effort to return to the site as soon as possible, by the fastest means possible. The spell will even hold a group to the location if the place is ruined, sinks, or has been disintegrated. The spell only ends if the spell focus is broken, ruined, dispelled or the focus is taken beyond the range of the spell.

The wine becomes any of the ingested poisons listed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game; you cannot transform wine into a contact, inhaled or injury poison. Thus, although you could transform wine into the equivalent of “lich dust” (save Fortitude DC 17; onset 10 minutes; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive saves), you could not transform it into the equivalent of wyvern poison.

Creatures caught within the globe are nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds and take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6). Half this damage is cold damage and half is negative energy damage, with a successful Reflex save resulting in the creature being sickened for 1 round and reducing the damage by half. Undead creatures in the area of effect ignore cold damage from this spell and are not nauseated or sickened, even as the negative energy heals them of 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 12d6). Blackburst dispels any light spells of lower than 9th level within its area.

Anyone looking through the area of a blackout with darkvision cannot see into or past the area of this spell.

Black Blizzard				CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=9								SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning									TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Long				TARGETAREA:Cylinder (180-ft. radius, 50 ft. high)																												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds									SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:You conjure an immense and extremely violent sand storm. The storm obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20 percent miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50 percent miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Perception checks suffer a -8 penalty. Ranged weapons, other than siege weapons, are impossible to operate; siege weapons suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. Movement through the area is considered difficult terrain even for flying creatures; each square counts as 2 squares of movement. The swirling sands and debris deal 8d6 bludgeoning damage +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knock them prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the bludgeoning damage and negates being knocked prone. Flying creatures are forced to the ground by the powerful downdraft and take damage as if they fell unless they make a successful Fly check (DC 10 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier), in which case they remain at their original altitude. Creatures that are knocked prone are buried beneath the sand. Buried creatures are protected from the swirling sands above but take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from the sand's weight per minute spent under the sand. If rendered unconscious, the victim must make a Constitution check (DC 15 + 1 per previous check) each minute or suffer 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. In addition to the aforementioned physical damage, a buried creature also lacks breathable air and immediately starts suffocating. A buried creature can free itself by making a DC 15 Strength check. The DC increases by +2 for each previous failed check. Creatures that aren't buried can dig out their friends in 1 round; however, precisely locating a creature buried beneath the sand requires a DC 25 Perception check.

Plants in the area also take on this form; they are unharmed and return to normal after the spell ends. Inspection is unlikely to reveal the altered nature of the plants (Perception DC 15 + your caster level + your relevant caster ability modifier), though success reveals a tiny metallic jingling of the clashing leaves or blades of grass. The area is considered difficult terrain and creatures passing through the area must make a successful Reflex save or suffer 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage for every 5 ft. traversed in addition to injury to the feet and legs (Staggered for 24 hours, a successful Heal check [DC equal to spell's DC] negates this condition). A victim in the area of effect at the time of casting suffers 6d6 points of damage in addition to the potential penalties of moving through the area. Plants affected or created by blades of jade are immune to other spells altering plant growth, movement, or maturity such as, entangle or plant growth, and any plants already under the effects of such spells can't be affected by blades of jade.

A target must make a save for each facial feature; failure removes one set of features. Note that permanently removing the victim's features causes various adverse effects. Remove curse does not remove blank face.

By infecting the target with a minute amount of negative energy, this spell accelerates injuries to living tissue and makes wounds more serious. Even a small knife wound can be made to bleed more heavily, the flesh around it turning septic as the spell works its dark magic. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray takes an additional 1d6 damage every time it takes damage from any weapon or non-energy damage source (so not from spells that deal energy damage, or breath weapons) for the duration of the spell. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, plants or oozes.

A night-black flame begins to burn on the victim's body. If the victim fails a Fortitude save, it suffers 4 points Constitution drain. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 4 rounds (5 rounds total) to avoid being drained of an additional 4 points of Constitution per round. The caster gains 10 temporary hit points whenever it drains 4 points of Constitution. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the victim is slain by blightfire ray, only icy fragments of the victim remain.

Once created, the cloud is stationary. This spell functions like obscuring mist except that fire spells do not burn off the mist. Water- and cold-based spells such as cone of cold or sleet storm will clear out the smoke and ash, however. Anyone within the cloud takes 2d6 fire damage each round. Affect- ed creatures may attempt a Reflex save for half damage. Spell resistance applies normally to the fire damage. This spell does not function underwater.

If the hole is opened directly below a creature, the creature is smashed into the hole, taking 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage from the block and 1d6 for every 10 feet it forces the creature to fall. Only creatures directly above the pit risk falling in. Creatures are buried by the stone block at the bottom of the pit; it takes 1 minute to uncover a creature buried at the bottom of the pit; a buried creature can free itself with a successful Strength Check DC 19. Any creature standing in the area where you first conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to move to safely to the nearest open space (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) but it still suffers the damage from being struck by the stone block as it leaves the area. In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw, with a +2 bonus, to avoid falling into it. At any point during the duration of the spell other targets may be forced into this pit by means such as a bull rush. Those creatures do not receive a saving throw. The pit's smooth, greased, stone walls have a Climb DC of 30 and a climber must make a successful Reflex save each round or be forced to move at half his climbing rate. Once the spell ends, the pit and the block disappear and the creature is deposited harmlessly on the surface.

The initial damage of this spell is 4d6 hit points and 2 points of Constitution damage. A successful save reduces the hit point damage by half and negates the ability damage. This spell only works on creatures that have blood to crystallize.

A target under the effects of this spell suffers double damage from all slashing or piercing attacks and double damage from bleed effects (such as those suffered by a dying character). This increased damage stacks with any damage done by a critical hit. This spell does not affect creatures with the construct, elemental, plant, ooze, or undead creature type. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.

You can create one creature for every four levels (so, a 20th level cleric could spawn five of these creatures). Each blood protector created costs one hit point's worth of shed blood. Blood protectors appear humanoid but have no distinct features; their bodies are clearly composed of fresh blood, somehow held together in largely solid form. The warriors appear to have armor molded to them, and each one wields a shield and either a short spear or short sword (your choice) with a +5 enhancement bonus. These warriors count as constructs. They do not have names, personalities, or any sense of self, but can follow simple orders. After the spell fades, or if they are destroyed, they revert to drops of blood.

The target creature suffers 2 points of Constitution damage and 4d6 fire damage per round. A heal spell cast during this time saves the creature's life, healing the damage and negating the spell.

An affected creature suffers excruciating pain, taking an immediate 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). In addition, it moves at half its normal speed and it takes a –4 circumstance penalty on Dexterity as its limbs stiffen. At the same time, the creature's skin hardens and becomes more resilient, improving its natural armor bonus by +2. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.) As well, the creature is no longer subject to critical hits and sneak attacks (or other effects that depend on having a discernable anatomy), since its vital organs are effectively shielded by the thickening blood. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and prevents all other effects (even those that could be beneficial). Blood to sap can target only living creatures with a discernable anatomy and a bloodstream. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead (except those with the blood drain ability) are immune to the effects of this spell.

At the druid's option, these plants can be flowers or normal undergrowth such as grass and weeds. Blossoming footsteps only functions in rounds when the druid moves. The plants do not hinder movement or provide cover on their own, nor does their growth damage the surface where they grow. They can, however, be targeted by spells such as entangle or plant growth. When the spell's duration expires, the plants either continue to live normally if the ground is suitable, or else melt away.

Boiling Sea					CLASSES:Druid=9									SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Earth|Fire|Water		TYPE:Divine			COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long				TARGETAREA:Water in a volume of ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft. by ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft./level by ((CASTERLEVEL)*2) ft., or one geyser of super-heated water filling a 5 ft. square and spraying upward ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) ft.	DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL)*10) minutes (D)							SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:No					DESC:This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly superheat to the point of boiling. The second version causes water to surge from superheated seas deep beneath the earth to rise up, and create as massive geyser. Boiling sea deals 1d6 points of fire damage per round of exposure (no save). If a creature is fully immersed it deals 10d6 points of fire damage per round of exposure (no save). In addition, those wearing metal armor are affected as if by a heat metal spell (no save). Breathing air within the range of the boiling sea spell deals 1d6 points of fire damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a -4 penalty on their saves. Geyser. Any creature entering the geyser, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then falling to the ground. If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 10d6 points of damage (half bludgeoning, half fire) from the super-heated water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 130 feet tall, the creature takes 13d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the vent. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). In addition, the geyser sprays superheated water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the geyser's height (e.g., a 130-foot geyser has a 65-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including you, takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round as scalding water cascades on them. You can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of superheated rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height boiling sea spell.

Bone Chill					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=5					SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:Cloud spreads 40 ft. wide and 40 ft. high																												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds									SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial				SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:This spell creates a cloud of cold necromantic energy that freezes the bones and blood of all living creatures touched by it. Living creatures within the dark cloud take 3d6 points of cold damage each round they are inside the cloud. Those within the cloud are also staggered. A successful Fortitude save negates the staggered condition, but even with a successful save, being inside the cloud still causes 1d6 points of cold damage each round. Once cast, the spellcaster can shift the position of the bone chill cloud by 10 feet per round; however, the caster can take no other actions while moving the cloud.

This eruption inflicts 1d6 points of damage to the subject. If the creature survives, it can then use the spikes as weapons for the duration of the spell. The spikes add +1 point of damage to any grapple, natural, or unarmed attacks the subject makes.

This may manifest as rudeness, boorishness or complete disinterest depending on the subject's attitudes before being affected by the spell. Creatures with a Charisma of 1 cannot cast spells as a sorcerer or bard does; if the creature is subject to damage or another penalty that would reduce its Charisma below 1, the spell ends.

Borrow Limb					CLASSES:Alchemist,Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=4			SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You																																		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours (D)																						DESC:You attach the severed forelimb of another creature to your torso, using it as an additional off-hand. You can use it to make an additional attack in a full-attack action, albeit at a –6 off-hand penalty (reduced to –3 if you have the Two- Weapon Fighting feat). You can also use it to wield a shield at no penalty (you can wield only one shield at a time). Additionally, you can hold objects or weapons in two hands and still cast spells with somatic components. When the spell ends, the limb falls off painfully, dealing 1d3 points of damage and impeding your concentration. You also can use this spell to attach a limb to the stump of one of your limbs that has been severed. In this case, the spell's duration changes to Instantaneous, and you may gain some special property of the limb if it has any (a troll's arm might regenerate, for instance, or a gargoyle's stony arm might function as a shield). The GM may shorten the duration if the limb has special properties (to 1 minute/ level or even (CASTERLEVEL) rounds). If the limb is from a living creature that was not offered freely, the spell gains the Evil descriptor.

You may touch a target creature to borrow the ranks it has in any one skill. On your next action, you can make a single skill check using the subject's ranks, but modified by your own key ability. If a skill check requires more than 1 round to make, you may not use this spell to borrow that skill.

Bouncing Boom				CLASSES:Summoner=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=6					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation									TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One bouncing ball that moves each round, exploding in a 20-foot radius burst																						DURATION:5 rounds											SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:You create a coruscating ball of swirling multicolored energy that drops from above and lands where directed, only to bounce back into the air. Each round, bouncing boom drops to the surface, then bounces up again. When it lands each round, it deals 5d6 damage of a different energy type to all creatures in a 20-foot-radius burst. You can select any one of the standard five energy types but you must select a different energy type each round, and you cannot repeat an energy type for the duration of the spell. After the first round (where you determine the point where the ball drops), determine the ball's bouncing direction; you can have it land anywhere along that straight path up to 30 feet before it detonates again (it must move a minimum of 5 feet). If the ball hits an obstruction, such as a wall, tree, or person, it detonates there and then moves along a 5-foot path, though after detonating there it can bounce and clear a 10-foot tall obstruction before moving along that 5-foot path. Repeat this process each round for a total of 5 rounds. Bouncing boom is considered to have the energy descriptor appropriate to the type of damage it is currently dealing. It has no descriptor the instant it is being cast.

Brain Drain					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=9						SCHOOL:Necromancy														TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Long				TARGETAREA:One living creature																															DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Fort partial					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:You extract the knowledge and memories from a target creature within range. The spell drains Intelligence from the subject until only 1 point of Intelligence remains and the target is driven insane as per the insanity spell. The caster is free to draw on all memories and Intelligencebased skills of the victim, using the victim's skill ranks, but modified by the caster's Intelligence, feats, and any other miscellaneous modifiers. After 1 hour the ability to access the victim's Intelligence-based skills ends, but you can still draw upon its other memories with a successful Intelligence check (DC 15). If the save succeeds, the Intelligence drain is negated, and the caster cannot access its memories or Intelligence-based skills, the victim instead takes 9d6 points of damage and is staggered for 1 round. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is also immune to that same caster's brain drain spell for 24 hours after the staggered condition ends.

Break Object				CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Druid,Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:10 ft.			TARGETAREA:One object of up to ((CASTERLEVEL)*10) cu. ft. or one construct creature																							DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object), and see text	DESC:This spell damages objects, reducing the object's hit point total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total (the object cannot be repaired or gain hit points using this spell). This also causes the object to gain the broken condition; this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. Magic items can be broken by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than the caster level of the object. This spell also deals 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 5d6) but it cannot reduce the construct's total hit point total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total. When break object is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.

Breathtwist					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=1						SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You																																		DURATION:1 minute or until discharged																					DESC:You change the nature of your energy breath weapon. It deals a different type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) the next time you use it (within one minute). All other parameters of the breath weapon (range, shape, damage, and so on) remain unchanged. This spell is an acid spell when you change your breath weapon to acid, a cold spell when you change it to cold, and so on. This spell has no effect on creatures without a breath weapon. Using a magic item such as a potion of fire breath counts as having a breath weapon.

The bridge is always 5 feet wide and can span a gap of up to 10 feet per caster level. The bridge must connect to two solid surfaces or the spell fails. The bridge itself can hold up to 2,000 pounds plus 100 pounds per caster level.

DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds									SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:The target is temporarily teleported away in a random direction to a random distance (roll 1d8 north, north east, east, etc.) and a random distance (d100 x caster level feet). The teleported creature or object appears in as safe an area as possible, so it is simply inconvenienced, not endangered (assuming the world has places that could qualify; if cast in the Plane of Fire, for example, anywhere would be dangerous). At the end of the spell's duration, the targeted creature is returned to the exact spot from which it was dispatched. If the spot it was in is occupied, the target appears in the nearest open space.

The spell reveals only magically-obscured creatures or objects, not hidden features such as secret doors and traps, or other invisible features such as invisible spell effects.

The mass is sticky and pliable, and can adhere to inanimate objects, walls, ceilings, floors, and so on. You can divide the brightmatter into smaller separate pieces, but doing so reduces the amount of light that each piece sheds. Brightmatter does not generate heat.

Brilliant Strike				CLASSES:Inquisitor,Magus,Sorcerer,Wizard=4				SCHOOL:Transmutation													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You																																		DURATION:1 round																									DESC:One weapon you wield briefly changes into a brilliant energy weapon. A significant portion of one weapon you are wielding transforms into light, although this does not modify the item's weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and Pieces Bright Shadowy other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects. The benefits of this spell can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons and ammunition.

Brimstone					CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=1					SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation			DESCRIPTOR:Air| Fire			TYPE:Arcane			COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 ft.				TARGETAREA:One smoking stone in your palm																														DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until expended (D)					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes				DESC:A fiery, smoking stone the size of a walnut appears in your palm. The stone is hot enough to ignite flammable materials and deals 1d4 points of fire damage each round that it stays in contact with a creature or object, but won't hurt you or your equipment as long as you keep it in hand. You can use the stone to make a melee touch attack or you can throw it as a splash weapon, making a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 120 feet. If the stone is wielded by any other creature, treat it as an improvised melee weapon (–4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls) or as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Note, though, that any other creature wielding it takes damage each round in which the stone is held. When the stone hits (either as a ranged or melee attack), it breaks and releases a flash of heat and acrid smoke. The flash deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4, no save) to the target struck, while all creatures in adjacent squares (including the target and the wielder if the wielder isn't you) must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) disperses the smoke and negates its effects.

Within the brimstone storm, add +4 to the DC of all Perception checks, and all land movement is at one-half speed. While the stones fall, and for 1 round per caster level thereafter, acrid smoke fills the area, obscuring all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20 percent miss chance), while creatures farther away have total concealment (50 percent miss chance), and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target. A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 1 round. A living creature entering the smoke or caught within it must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains inside and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that makes a successful save but remains within the smoke must make another Fortitude save each round, with the DC increasing by 1 point per round the creature has spent within the smoke.

Unlike lightning bolt, brilliant arc strikes one object or creature initially, and then arcs to other targets. The bolt inflicts 1d4 hit points of electrical damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d4) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal 1 hit point of electrical damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5 points). Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

Suitable targets include wanted posters, notices, or letters. As long as the target is within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) of you, you can concentrate to activate the sensor. When you do so, you can see through the sensor as if looking through a window. The sensor within the paper can be noticed as usual (observant creatures might notice a subtle pattern of eyes appearing in the written material). The spell ends immediately if the paper is damaged. This spell can be made permanent with a permanency spell (min.

This results in the usual penalties to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, bull's strength, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Bull's curse counters bull's strength.

The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6) and inflicts the confused condition. Upon a successful Reflex save a subject suffers only half damage. Upon a successful Will save a subject suffers the confusion effect for only 1 round and is thereafter immune to that same caster's burbling blast of the jabberwock spell for 24 hours. The confusion effect is mind-affecting; both are sonic effects. Remove curse does not remove the confusion effect. Greater restoration, miracle, or wish can restore the creature.

The caster telepathically implants the suggestion into the subject. The suggestion planted must not take place immediately. When it occurs it must be based on an event or an amount of time going by. At least three days must pass before the suggestion compels the subject. During the period while the suggestion is buried, neither divination spells nor Sense Motive will reveal that the subject is under the effect of an enchantment. Attempts to remove the suggestion during this period, such as with dispel magic or break enchantment, add a +10 bonus to the DC. The subject does not attempt his saving throw until the triggering event occurs.

Divination spells cannot detect subjects within dead-magic areas, nor can a spellcaster use teleport or another spell to move into or out of the zone. The only exception to the “no magic” rule is permanent planar portals, which still function normally. Zones created by this spell can be repaired, but only by a heightened limited wish (8th level or higher), miracle, or wish spell.
