
#	VARTYPEDEF:x|y

#	x is a legal data format (currently NUMBER, GRIDPOINT)
#	y is a name for the data type ("traditional variables" should be defined as "VAR", other items are up to the data team)
#	Known Limitations:

#	x will have a lot more legal values going forward (STRING, etc. - many of those that are legal on QUALIFY today) 
#	Note that a y value MUST have a VARTYPEDEF in the Data Control file for it to be legal in the "y" slot of LOCAL in the Variable File.

# FACTDEF and FACTSETDEF Proposals use this


#	FACTDEF:x|y|z <> ...tokens...
#	x is a file type (e.g. DEITY for Deity LST files)
#	y is the identifier type (STRING, etc.)
#	z is the identifier (then usable as x in the FACT LST token)
