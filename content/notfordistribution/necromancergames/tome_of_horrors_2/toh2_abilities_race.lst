#Aberrant 7

Oversized Weapon (Ex): An aberrant wields a Huge greatclub without penalty.


#Abyssal Wolf 8
Paralyzing Gaze (Su): Anyone within 40 feet meeting the gaze of an abyssal wolf must make a successful Will save (DC 16) or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Half-fiends and tieflings have a -2 penalty on their save. Once a successful save is made, the target is immune to the effects of that abyssal wolf's gaze attack for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Trip (Ex): An abyssal wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+9 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the abyssal wolf.
Favored Prey (Ex): An abyssal wolf has a +2 bonus on Listen, Sense Motive, and Spot checks against non-evil half fiends and tieflings.
Keen Scent (Ex): An abyssal wolf can detect prey within 60 feet by sense of smell. This range increases to 120 feet if the opponents are upwind; and decreases to 30 feet if downwind. By making a successful Wisdom check (DC 15) the abyssal wolf can determine whether a tiefling or half-fiend is present among the opponents.
Know Alignment (Su): Abyssal wolves always know the alignment of any creature they look upon. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the abyssal wolf can activate it again as a free action on its next turn.
Skills: An abyssal wolf has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent. This bonus rises to +6 when tracking non-evil half fiends or tieflings by scent.



#Ahlinni (Cackle Bird) 9
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every three rounds as a standard action, an ahlinni can expel a pinkish gas in a 20-foot cone. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC Fortitude save or fall prone, laughing manically as if affected by a Tashaa's hideous laughter spell (caster level 4th). The effects last 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution- based.
Impale (Ex): When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals 2d8+4 points of damage on a successful strike with its bite attack.
Birdsong (Su): An ahlinni can freely communicate with any bird or bird-like creature (such as rocs, giant eagles, and giant owls), perfectly mimicking any bird song or vocalization. Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100 feet. In this case, this ability functions as a speak with animals spell (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Fast Healing (Ex): An ahlinni heals 2 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.
Skills: *An ahlinni has a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in treetops. An ahlinni has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks, and can take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Angel, Empyreal 10
An empyreal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Radiant Blast (Su): Once per day, an empyreal can increase the radiance of its form and release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 feet that deals 15d6 points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can attempt a DC 21 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is Constitution- based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-aid, continual flame, detect evil, discern lies (DC 19), dispel magic, holy smite (DC 18), invisibility (self only), remove curse (DC 17), remove disease (DC 17), remove fear (DC 15); 2/day-blade barrier (DC 20), cure moderate wounds (DC 16), flame strike (DC 19), scorching ray (3 rays); 1/day-heal, raise dead. Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spells: Empyreals can cast spells as 13th-level clerics. An empyreal has access to any two of the following domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based. Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (6/6/ 6/5/4/3/2/1; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-create water, guidance, light, purify food and drink, read magic, resistance; 1st-bless (x2), bless water, command, divine favor (x2); 2nd- align weapon, bull's strength, consecrate, hold person(x2), silence; 3rd- cure serious wounds,daylight, invisibility purge, searing light (x2); 4th-dimensional anchor, divine power, inflict critical wounds, summon monster IV; 5th-greater command, mark of justice, plane shift; 6th-harm, planar ally; 7th-summon monster VII. Domain Spells (Good, War): 1st-protection from evil; 2nd- spiritual weapon; 3rd-magic vestment; 4th-holy smite; 5th-dispel evil; 6th-blade barrier; 7th-holy word.

Aura of Goodness (Su): An empyreal radiates an aura in a 30-foot radius spread around its form. Any non-evil creature in this area attempting to attack the empyreal must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be overcome with awe and unable to take any action, other than a move action that round. Evil creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be unable to even look at that empyreal for one day. An affected evil creature functions as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking that empyreal. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the aura of goodness of that empyreal for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.	SOURCEPAGE:p.11

#Arcanoplasm 11
Acid (Ex): An arcanoplasm secretes a highly corrosive acid that dissolves only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Constrict (Ex): An arcanoplasm deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an arcanoplasm must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Arcane Spell Mimicry (Ex): An arcanoplasm can mimic any arcane spell of 4th level or lower that is cast within 30 feet of it. The spell takes effect on the arcanoplasm's next action, has a caster level of 7th, and does not require any components. The save against a mimicked spell has a DC of 12 + the level of the spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Absorb Arcane Magic (Ex): Any arcane spell cast at an arcanoplasm is automatically absorbed. This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell would otherwise deal (non-damaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell level of the spell). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they affect an arcanoplasm. An arcanoplasm cannot absorb divine magic and is affected by it normally.
Amorphous (Ex): Arcanoplasms have no discernable front or back and are not subject to critical hits. They cannot be flanked.
Arcanesense (Su): An arcanoplasm can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 100 feet. This functions as a detect evil spell but there is no chance the arcanoplasm is stunned and it is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material.

#12
Blindsight (Ex): An arcanoplasm's entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.
Immunities (Ex): Arcanoplasms are immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.
Skills: An arcanoplasm has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Asrai 12
Spells: An asrai casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer. The save DC against a spell cast by an asrai is 12 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Typical Sorcerer Spells Prepared (Cast per Day 6/7/ 5; save DC 12 + spell level): 0-dancing lights, daze (x2), detect magic, flare, resistance, touch of fatigue; 1st-hypnotism, obscuring mist, reduce person, sleep; 2nd-Tashaa's hideous laughter, touch of idiocy. Spell-Like Abilities: 2/day-control water, fog cloud, obscuring mist. Caster level 5th.
Cold (Su): The touch of an asrai is supernaturally cold. All damage dealt from an asrai's natural attacks is cold damage. This ability is constant, but the asrai can suppress or resume it at will as a free action.
Water Dependent (Su): An asrai that moves more than 50 feet from her water source, can survive on land for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG). Lost Constitution points are immediately restored if she is returned to the water. If her Constitution reaches 0, she dies, her form collapsing into a puddle of water.
Skills: An asrai has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Asrai use their Dexterity modifier (instead of Strength modifier) on Swim checks.

#Barbegazi (Ice Gnome) 14
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-chill metal (DC 12), icicle blast (as burning hands, but shards of ice that deal cold damage) (DC 11). Caster level 3rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +2 racial bonus.
Snow Move (Ex): Because of its oversized flat feet, a barbegazi can walk on top of deep snow and suffers no penalties when moving through snowy terrain.
Skills: Barbegazis receive a +2 racial bonus to Craft (trapmaking), Hide and Survival checks. *The Hide bonus increases to +6 in their natural environment.

#Bedlam 14
Chaos Burst (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a bedlam can release a burst of crackling gray energy in a 20-foot radius around itself. Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non- chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A DC 18 Will save halves the damage. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution based.
Chaotic Resonance (Su): A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic matter. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the b e d l a m . Spellcasters in the area must make a s u c c e s s f u l caster level check (DC 18) each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round. A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. The check DC and save DC is Constitution based. Spells with the "chaotic" descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons (anarchic weapons) deal an extra 1d6 points of damage while in this area (i.e., an anarchic weapon deals an extra 3d6 points of chaotic damage against lawful- aligned foes). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura.
Detect Law (Su): A bedlam can continuously detect law as the spell (caster level 10th), though there is no chance of it becoming stunned by overwhelming lawful auras. It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
Immunity to Chaos (Ex): The bedlam cannot be affected by any spell, spell-like ability, weapon, magic item, or supernatural effect that has the chaotic or anarchic descriptor. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this immunity and can attack the bedlam normally.
Immunity to Transformation (Ex): No mortal magic can affect or fix a bedlam's ever-shifting chaotic form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into its new shape for a moment, but it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action at the start of its next turn.
Resistance to Law Spells (Ex): The bedlam has SR 20 against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects with the "law" descriptor. This spell resistance also applies to spells of the Law domain.
Skills: *A bedlam's grayish coloration grants it a +8 racial bonus to Hide checks when in areas of thick fog or smoke.

# Giant Beetle Shared
Tremorsense (Ex): Giant beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.

#Beetle, Giant Blister 16
Blister Spray (Ex): Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, a blister beetle can shoot a jet of inky black liquid in a 20-foot line. A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid the spray. On a failed save, the target takes 1d3 points of acid damage and a -2 conditional modifier on attack rolls and ability and skill checks for the next 1 minute (10 rounds) from painful blisters and welts that quickly appear on exposed skin. A DC 10 Heal check or any cure spell heals the blisters and negates the penalties. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Skills: *Blister beetles have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in their natural surroundings.
#Beetle, Giant Saw-tooth 17
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a giant saw- toothed beetle must hit an opponent up to one size larger with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold.
#Beetle, Giant Water 17
Ink Cloud (Ex): A giant water beetle can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the giant water beetle normally uses to escape. All vision within the cloud is obscured.
Water Dependent (Ex): Giant water beetles can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG.
Watersense (Ex): Giant water beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.
Skills: *Underwater, a giant water beetle has a +4 bonus on Hide and Spot checks. A giant water beetle has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

#Bloodsuckle 18
Blood Drain (Ex): A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases the victim so it can continue to rely on it as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts (see below) unless they are extremely hungry.
Create Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special sap into the victim that disrupts the synapses in the victim's brain and transforms it into a host if it fails a DC 18 Will save. This acts as a dominate monster spell (caster level 8th) with no duration. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. A victim that fails its Will save becomes a host for the bloodsuckle, and returns to the plant whenever it calls. A host is normally only used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack, it may summon its hosts to defend it. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save (same DC) with a +4 bonus to break the effects of the bloodsuckle's control.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bloodsuckle must hit a creature of any size with a tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can drain blood.
Seed (Ex): Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off, and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open, growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. At Constitution 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell destroys the seedling as do spells such as limited wish, wish, or miracle.
# 19
Summon Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle can generate a high- pitched whine that only its hosts can hear. A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant. So long as the bloodsuckle and its host are on the same plane of existence, the host hears and answers the call. Usually, a bloodsuckle only calls its hosts when it becomes hungry for blood-about once every three days.
Blindsight (Ex): A bloodsuckle has no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.
Host Sense (Ex): A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any of its hosts to a range of 100 feet.

#Bog Creeper 19
Constrict (Ex): A bog creeper that makes a successful grapple
check against an opponent of its size or smaller using a tendril
attack deals 1d4+4 points of damage each round the hold is
maintained.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bog creeper must hit
with a tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Spit Acid (Ex): Three times per day, a bog creeper can spray a
cone of digestive acid to a range of 30 feet that deals 2d8 points of
acid damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex save DC 20 for
half). It cannot use this ability if it is currently holding a creature
in its mouth. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Camouflage (Ex): When at rest, a bog creeper appears as a
normal plant. It takes a successful DC 20 Spot check to notice it
before it attacks. Anyone with Survival or Knowledge (nature)
can use those skills instead of Spot to notice the plant.
Marsh Move (Ex): A bog creeper can move across marshy
terrain without incurring any movement penalties.
Marshsense (Ex): Bog creepers can automatically detect the
location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the same
marshy ground it is.
Skills: A bog creeper has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided
it swims in a straight line.

#Brass Man 20
Spit Molten Brass (Su): Once every 1d4
rounds (and no more than five times per
day), a brass man can spit a stream of
molten brass in a 30-foot line; damage
6d6 fire, Reflex DC 15 half.
The save DC is Constitution-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A brass man is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In
addition, certain spells and effects function differently
against the creature, as noted below.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a
brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving
throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow
effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each
3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full
normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit
points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.

#Burning Dervish 21
Flame Form (Su): Three times per day, as a standard
action, a burning dervish can change its form to
that of a column of fire. In this form it gains two slam
attacks and deals 1d6 points of fire damage each time
it hits or grapples an opponent. Additionally, a foe
must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire.
Creatures hitting a burning dervish in flame form
with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire
damage as though hit by the burning dervish's attack,
and also catch on fire unless they make a successful
Reflex save.
Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day-invisibility (self only),
pyrotechnics (DC 14); 2/day-enlarge person (DC 13)
or reduce person (DC 13) (either can be used on the
burning dervish), produce flame. Caster level 14th.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Elemental Endurance (Ex): Burning dervishes can
survive on the Elemental Planes of Air or Earth for
up to 48 hours and on the Elemental Plane of Water
for up to 12 hours. Failure to return to the Elemental
Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies after that
time deals 1 point of damage per hour to a
burning dervish until it dies or returns
to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
Plane Shift (Sp): A
burning dervish can
enter any of the elemental
planes, the
Astral Plane, or
the Material
Plane. This
ability transports
the
burning dervish
and up to eight other
creatures, provided they all
link hands with the burning
dervish. I t i s
otherwise similar to the
spell of the same name
(caster level 13th).

#Cadaver 22
Disease (Ex): Filth fever-claw or bite, Fortitude
save DC 11, incubation period 1d3 days; damage 1d3
Dexterity and 1d3 Constitution (see Disease in the
DMG). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Reanimation (Ex): When reduced to 0 hit points or
less, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather it begins the
process of reanimating by regaining 1 hit point per
round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are
not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit
point total (minus damage dealt from magical attacks
and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again.
If the creature is destroyed by a cleric's turning
ability, it cannot reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle
repose on the cadaver when it reaches 0 hit points, it
cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation,
causing the creature to regain hit points at half
its normal rate (i.e., 1 hit point every other round).

#Caterprism 23
Crystal Silk (Ex): Three times per day, as a standard
action, a caterprism can spew forth a crystalline
silk-like substance in a 20-foot cone. The substance
instantly solidifies to a rock-like hardness, forming
needle-sharp spears of crystal that impale those in the
area and deal 3d6 points of piercing damage. A DC 17
Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based.
Crystalline Mandibles (Ex): The mandibles of a
caterprism are so powerful that they can bite through
nearly anything. The bite attack of a caterprism is
treated like a touch attack; i.e., it ignores any armor
bonus.
Further, the bite of a caterprism is considered to have the
vorpal special quality, and on a successful critical hit with its
bite attack, the caterprism severs the head of its opponent.

#Cave Leech 24
Blood Drain (Su): A cave leech can suck blood from a
foe with its bite by making a successful grapple check. If it
pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution
drain each round the pin is maintained.
Constrict (Ex): A cave leech deals 1d4+2 points of
damage with a successful grapple check. If an opponent is
being grappled when a tentacle is severed, the tentacle
continues to constrict and deals one-half damage (1d2+1).
(See tentacles, below.)
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cave leech
must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. A cave leech
gains a +4 bonus to its attack roll if it bites a grappled foe.
Tentacles (Ex): A single tentacle is AC 13 and has 5 hit
points. Damaging a tentacle does not harm the cave leech
itself. Severing a tentacle does not break its hold on a
creature it is grappling, but does reduce the damage by one
half (see constrict, above). A severed tentacle has a grapple
check of +2, and a severed tentacle regrows in 1d4 days.
Tremorsense (Ex): A cave leech can automatically
sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in
contact with the ground.
Skills: Cave leeches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide
checks.
A cave leech has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,
provided it swims in a straight line.

#Cerebral Stalker 25
Consume Brain (Ex): Once it has its victim underground, the
cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly
chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4 points of damage
each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker has
reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours.
A victim slain in this manner is ejected from ground and becomes
a zombie (see below).
Create Zombie (Su): A creature whose brain is devoured by a
cerebral stalker is ejected from the ground and animates as a
zombie in 1d4 rounds. Zombies created in this manner are not
under the control of the cerebral stalker.
Fear Gaze (Su): The eyes of a cerebral stalker instill fear in
living creatures that meet its gaze. Creatures must succeed on a DC
16 Will save or stand shaking in fear and unable to act for 1d4
rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting
fear effect. On a successful save, that creature is immune to the fear
gaze of that cerebral stalker for one day.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cerebral stalker must
hit with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple
as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it
wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can
use its web ability to cocoon its foe.
Web (Ex): Once per round, and no
more than three times per day, a
cerebral stalker can cocoon a
grappled foe by shooting sticky
webbing from its body. The
webs cover as much of the
victim as possible, excluding
the top of the
victim's head, its eyes,
and its nose. The
webs remain attached
to the
cerebral stalker's
body and stretch
from just under its
arms to its knees.
A webbed victim
is anchored to
the cerebral
stalker and cannot
move.


The webbed creature can, as a standard action, break free with a
successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check.
The webbing has 8 hit points and a DR of 5/fire. Note the victim
is still grappled even if it breaks the webbing and must succeed at
a grapple check to get completely free of the cerebral stalker's
grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength
check includes a +4 racial bonus.
# 26
Earth Glide (Ex): A cerebral stalker can glide through
stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as
easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves
behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or
other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area
containing a burrowing cerebral stalker flings the cerebral
stalker back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless
it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 15).
Sink (Su): After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker
begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim
with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to
completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the
creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist;
in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both
stalker and foe are completely underground. Creatures
attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the
sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above),
and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral
stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking
cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold person spell) for a
number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker
fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each
round to negate the paralysis.
The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the
victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis).
The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk
radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as
locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory
magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom
spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk
immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects
both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the
surface.
Tremorsense (Ex): A cerebral stalker can automatically sense the location of any creature in contact with the ground to a range of 90 feet.
#Church Grim 27
Howl (Su): The howl of a church grim causes any evil
creature within its churchyard to succeed on a DC 14 Will
save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral
creatures are unaffected as long as they are not there to steal
from the dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save
is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same church
grim's howl for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Wisdom Damage (Su): The incorporeal bite of a church
grim deals 1d6 points of holy damage and 1d4 points of
Wisdom damage to a target. A successful DC 14 Fortitude
save negates the Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-
based. On each successful attack, the church grim
gains 5 temporary hit points.
Know Alignment (Su): A church grim makes automatically
knows the alignment of any creature that enters its churchyard.
This ability is always active and cannot be negated.

Limited Domain (Ex): The realm of a church grim
encompasses only the churchyard; it can wander freely in its
cemetery, the churchyard, and within the church itself. It
cannot move beyond the precincts of the churchyard; it
must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.
Rejuvenation (Su): A church grim reduced to 0 or less
hit points restores itself in 24 hours, completely healed, if it
makes a successful level check (1d20 + the church grim's
HD) against DC 16. The only sure way to get rid of a church
grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the
churchyard.
Soul Defender (Su): It is the sacred duty of a church grim
to defend the bodies and souls of those buried in its churchyard.
Any attempt to cast an animate dead or similar spell
within the confines of the church grim's domain requires
the caster to succeed on a DC 20 caster level check.
Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the
full wrath of the church grim immediately.

#Cinder Ghoul 28
Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a
cinder ghoul's slam attack gain one negative level.
The DC is 18 for the Fortitude save to remove a
negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.
For each such negative level bestowed, a cinder
ghoul gains 5 temporary hit points.
Fire (Su): Any opponent struck by a cinder
ghoul's slam attack must succeed on a DC 18
Reflex save or catch fire (see catching on fire in
the DMG). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Smoke Inhalation (Su): As a full round action,
a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its
smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent by
moving into a space occupied by an opponent.
The target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude
save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside
the victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues
and organs, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage
each round for 1d4+2 rounds. The affected
creature can attempt another Fortitude save each
round to cough out the burning residue. A successful
save halts the damage. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Smoke Form (Ex): A cinder ghoul's natural
form is similar to the gaseous form spell, though
the creature retains its natural armor bonus, all
attacks, and can use its supernatural abilities. Its
fly speed is 40 feet per round with perfect maneuverability.
A cinder ghoul is subject to the effects
of wind (in that it can be blown away, but it
cannot be dispersed and takes no damage from
wind). A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other
liquid and cannot pass through small holes or
narrow openings.

#Clamor 29
Sonic Burst (Ex): When angered, a clamor can emit a
massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round action
that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living
creature within 100 feet of the clamor must succeed on a DC
15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Further,
living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor must succeed
on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be permanently deafened. A
restoration, wish, miracle, or remove blindness/deafness spell
restores hearing and negates the stunning effect. The save
DCs are Constitution-based.
Natural Invisibility (Su): As creatures of living sound,
a clamor is naturally invisible, even when it attacks. This
ability is inherent and is not subject to the invisibility purge
spell.
Perfect Mimic (Ex): A clamor can duplicate any
sound it has ever encountered with near perfect accuracy
as a free action. Being accustomed to tone and
pitch, a bard may make a DC 20 Bardic Knowledge
check to determine that the sounds
are being produced artificially.
Another Bardic
Knowledge check (same
DC) allows the bard to realize
that the creature
making the sounds is indeed
a clamor. If the bard
has encountered a
clamor before, the
second check is not
required.
Speed of Sound (Ex): Once per day, a clamor can move
at the speed of sound for a number of minutes equal to its Hit
Dice. Its speed becomes 6,820 feet per round (1,364 squares),
but it cannot attack or make use of any of its other abilities
when moving this way.
Vulnerabilities (Ex): Any spell that creates a zone of
silence or vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor
and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal
to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score
modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the
following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.
Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism,
whispering wind: These magically generated or altered
sounds force a clamor to make a Will save (DC 10 + spell
level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act
as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds
equal to the caster's level.
Sculpt sound: Using this spell to warp the sound from
which the clamor is made, the caster deals 1d4 points of
damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude
save (DC 13 + the bard's Charisma modifier) for half
damage.
This spell also enables a bard (and only a bard) to
completely control the actions of a clamor if the
clamor fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level
+ the bard's Charisma modifier). If the clamor fails
the save, it is affected as if by a dominate monster
spell with a caster level equal to that of the
bard's class level.
Shout, sound burst: These spells do no
damage to a clamor, but force it to make a
Will save (DC 10 + spell level + the
caster's appropriate ability score
modifier) or be affected as if by a
charm monster spell with a caster
level equal to that of the
caster.

#Colossus, Jade 30
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4
rounds, as a standard action, a jade colossus can
spray a blast of green energy in either a 60-foot
cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the
affected area takes 15d6 points of damage (Reflex
save DC 26 for half). A creature slain as the result of this
breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is
Constitution-based.
A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This
effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or
miracle. This restores the creature's body to flesh; afterwards,
it may be raised or resurrected normally. A jade
creature that suffers 40 or more points of damage, or is subjected
to a shatter or disintegrate spell is immediately destroyed. A
destroyed creature can be restored only through the successful
casting of a miracle or wish spell.
Light Reflection (Ex): The angles that make up a jade
colossus's form allow it to reflect any light-based attacks or effects
(it cannot reflect natural sunlight however). Reflected light acts
as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that blinds all creatures (as the
blindness spell) within 40 feet for 2d4 rounds. Affected creatures
that succeed on a DC 26 Reflex save are not blinded. Undead and
similar creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points
of damage (a successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the damage).
Immunity to Magic (Ex): A
jade colossus is immune to any
spell or spell-like ability that
allows spell resistance. In addition,
certain spells and
effects function differently
against the
creature, as noted
below.
A disintegrate spell slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6
rounds, with no saving throw.
A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus,
with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect
on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points
of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of
healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points,
it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus receives
no saving throw against fire effects.



#Corpse Rook 32
Rend (Ex): A corpse rook that hits with two or more bite attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an extra 2d8+7 points of damage.
All-Around Vision (Ex): The three heads of a corpse rook grant it a +4 bonus to Search and Spot checks and prevent it from being flanked.

#Corpsespinner 33
Create Corpsespun (Su): Creatures slain (and not devoured)
by a corpsespinner rise in 1 hour as creatures known
as corpsespuns (see the Corpsespun template in this book).
Poison (Ex): The bite of a corpsespinner delivers a highly
toxic poison. The save DC is Constitution-based and
includes a +2 bonus from the corpsespinner's Ability Focus
feat.
Corpsespinner Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 22 negates,
initial and secondary 2d6 points of Intelligence damage. A
victim whose Intelligence drops to 0 dies in 1 hour unless
the poison is neutralized (such as with a neutralize poison
spell). Slain creatures rise as corpsespun (see its Create
Corpsespun ability above).
Web (Ex): A corpsespinner can fire sticky strands of web
constructed of astral material to a maximum range of 80 feet
(range increment 20 feet) up to 10 times per day. This
webbing is effective against targets up to one size smaller
than the corpsespinner and is similar to a net attack. The
web anchors the target in place allowing no movement.
An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC
24 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 28 Strength
check. Both are standard actions. The check DCs are
Constitution-based and include a +4 bonus because the
webs are constructed of astral material. The Strength check
DC also includes a +4 racial bonus.
A corpsespinner can also create sheets of webbing that
cover a 40-foot area. Approaching creatures must make a
successful DC 20 Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they
stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful
web attack. Attempts to escape gain a +5 bonus if the
trapped victim has something to walk on or grab while
pulling free. Each 5-foot section of web has 16 hit points
and damage reduction 5/-.
Astral Jaunt (Ex): A corpsespinner can shift from the
Astral Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift
back again as a move action (or during a move action). This
ability is otherwise identical with the astral projection spell,
except it only transports the corpsespinner.
Astralsense (Su): A corpsespinner can automatically
detect the location of anything within 200 feet of it on the
Astral Plane.
Skills: A corpsespinner can always take 10 on a Climb
check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Crag Man 34
Pierce (Ex): As a free action, a crag man can transform
its hands into stony points. When striking with its
hands in this manner, it deals 1d6+3 points of piercing
damage (rather than bludgeoning damage) with its slam
attack).
Piercer Hellstorm (Sp): Once per day, a crag man
can summon 2d10 piercers (see the revised entry for
piercers in the sidebar) with a 50% chance of success.
Passwall (Sp): Once per day, as a standard action, a
crag man can create an effect similar to the passwall spell
(caster level 3rd).
Stalagmite Form (Ex): A crag man's natural form is
that of a stalagmite. While in this form it does not
radiate magic and true seeing does not reveal its humanoid
form. The crag man can change forms as a free action
once per round.
Tremorsense (Ex): A crag man can automatically
detect the location of anything within 100 feet in
contact with the ground.
Skills: *Crag men receive
a +8 racial bonus to Hide
checks against a background
of stone.

#Crucifixion Spirit 35
Crucify Soul (Su): Once per round, a crucifixion spirit
can point at a single target within 60 feet and crucify its soul.
The crucifixion spirit must succeed on a ranged touch attack. If
successful, the target's soul leaves its body which collapses in a heap
on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of
the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed,
crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul
held in place by translucent spikes or nails, driven through the
soul's wrists and feet.
The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it.
Furthermore, a crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by
anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see
below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative
levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each
round thereafter.
A creature slain in this manner cannot be returned to life
except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection
spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the
check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.
A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability
for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks against a
different opponent.
A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by
succeeding on a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul
is freed and returns to its body in the same round. The target is
stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally.
The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22.
The save DCs are Charisma-based.
A crucifixion spirit can use this ability five times per day.
Paralysis (Su): A living creature hit by a crucifixion spirit's
incorporeal touch must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be
paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Remove paralysis or any other spell that
can remove a curse removes the paralysis. The effect cannot be
dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Immunity to Turning (Ex): A crucifixion
spirit cannot be
turned, rebuked,
or commanded.

#Demon, Caizel 36
Caizel's natural weapons,
as well as any weapons
she wields, are treated as
chaotic-aligned and
evil-aligned for the purpose
of overcoming
damage reduction.
Poison (Ex):
Caizel's body courses
with a virulent poison
that she can
intensify or suppress 

#37
at will. It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch is
not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body
fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter,
etc.). If a target is not willing to be kissed, she must start a
grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. Other methods
of delivery (such as consummation of an encounter) are not
detailed here.
Caizel's poison normally deals 1d8 points of Constitution
damage if the target fails a DC 25 Fortitude save. One minute later
another Fortitude save must be made to avoid another 1d8 points
of Constitution damage.
Caizel can vary the intensity of her poison at will. This
allows her to deliver 1, 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8 points of
Constitution damage (as both initial and secondary damage).
Alternately, she can suppress her poison completely,
thus dealing no ability damage whatsoever.

darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts,
doom (DC 19), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects

attempt to summon 1d4 chaaors (see their entry in this book) with

Touch of Ecstasy (Su): Once per round, by making a
melee touch attack against a foe, Caizel can flood the
creature's mind with the most pleasurable images it can
conjure if it fails a DC 25 Will save. This effect stuns the
creature for 1d4 rounds while its mind processes the information.
A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
by Caizel's touch of ecstasy for one day. The save DC is
Constitution-based. Caizel can suppress this ability at will.
Skills: Caizel has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.
Bonerazor: Bonerazor is a finely crafted and perfectly
balanced +2 dagger. Because of its expert craftsmanship it
deals 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit. Additionally,
a creature hit must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be held
(as by a hold person spell). The creature can make a new save
each round to escape. A creature remains held as long as
Bonerazor remains embedded in its body or until it makes a
successful Fortitude save. So long as Caizel is within 50 feet
of it, she can command the dagger to return to her hand as
a free action.

#Demon, Chaaor 37
A chaaor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-
aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
#38
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a chaaor
must hit an opponent up to one size larger than itself
with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes
a hold and can rend.
Rend (Ex): A chaaor that hits with both claw
attacks tears the flesh of its opponent. This
attack automatically deals 2d8+12 points of
damage.
Roar (Ex): Three times per day, a
chaaor can loose a powerful and
deadly roar that deals 3d6 points
of sonic damage to all creatures
within 60 feet that hear it. A
successful DC 17 Reflex
save halves the
damage.
In addition, creatures up to one size
smaller than the chaaor must succeed on a DC 17
Reflex save or be knocked prone from the force of its
roar. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Acid and Fire Spittle (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a
greruor can spit a stream of acid in a 30-foot line that deals
4d4 points of acid damage. On the greruor's next turn, the
acid ignites and the opponent bursts into flames, taking
1d6 points of fire damage per round until extinguished
(see the rules for Catching Fire in the DMG). A
successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the acid damage
and prevents the creature from catching fire. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a greruor
must hit with its tongue attack. It

#40
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and bites.

skin, a greruor has a +8 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks.

#Demon, Mallor 40
A mallor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-
aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Fear Gaze (Su): The infernal eyes of a mallor

that can breathe water) swimming in fouled water must
make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check)
each round they remain in the area or begin suffocating (see
Suffocation in the DMG).
Magical liquids in the area can make a DC 27
Fortitude save to avoid fouling.
A mallor can foul up to 20 gallons of liquid a day using
this ability. Sentient- or liquid-based creatures (such as
water elementals) must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save

#41
or take 1d8 points of Constitution damage each hour they
remain in the area. At Constitution 0, the creature's liquid
structure fouls and it dies. The save DCs are Constitution-
based. A mallor can suppress or resume this ability at will.

used against her by good-aligned creatures.
Skills: Because of her ability to lie without emotion,
Demoriel gains a +8 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,
and Gather Information checks.
Reaver: Reaver is a finely crafted +3 unholy short
sword.

#Devil, Flayer 51
A flayer devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Flensing (Ex): A flayer devil that scores a critical hit with
a claw attack rips the flesh from its opponent's body. This
attack deals 1d3 points of Constitution drain.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-detect good, greater teleport
(self plus 50 pounds of objects), scorching ray (3 rays); 1/day-
wall of fire, unholy aura (DC 20). Caster level 12th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
Summon Devils (Sp): Once per day, a flayer devil can
attempt to summon 1d4 bearded devils or barbed devils or
another flayer devil with a 35% chance of success.
Unholy Burst (Su): Three times per day, a flayer devil can
release a burst of hellish black vapor in a 30-foot radius. Those
caught within the area must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save
or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. Additionally, good-aligned
creatures suffer 3d6 points of unholy damage from the vapors
if they fail their save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Regeneration (Ex): A flayer devil takes normal damage
from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects
with the good descriptor.

#Devil, Hellstoker 52
A hellstoker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Bellows (Ex): A hellstoker can use its burning hands to light its
bellows as a standard action. This allows the hellstoker to fire a
jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per
round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch
attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of
fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch
on fire (see Catching on Fire in the DMG).
Fiery Body (Ex): The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly
flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into
flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, but does deal 1d6
points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the
hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds (1 minute) before
extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide;
therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks
(see oily hide below) and it can be caught on fire again.
Hellstokers sometimes light themselves or each other on
fire when combating foes.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-magic circle against
good (DC 13), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds
of objects only); 1/day-burning hands (DC
11 half). Caster level 10th. The save
DCs are Charisma-based.
A hellstoker can use its burning
hands ability to ignite itself or another
of its kind.
Summon Devils (Sp): Once per
day, a hellstoker can attempt to summon
2d8 lemures with a 50% chance
of success, or another hellstoker with
a 35% chance of success.
Oily Hide (Ex): Hellstokers do
not secrete oil naturally, but their
constant contact with it leaves them
coated with a thick layer of the
substance at all times. This grants
hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to
Escape Artist checks (included in
the statistics block). The oil cannot
be washed off or removed.
Additionally, if a hellstoker is
hit with a fire effect, it bursts into
flames. See the hellstoker's fiery
body above for details.

#Devil, Xaphan (Duke) 53
Xaphan's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields,
are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
Fiery Aura (Su): As a free action, Xaphan can cause his
entire body to erupt in unholy fire (the same fires he uses to stoke
his furnaces). Creatures within 5 feet of or grappling Xaphan take
1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage each
round. There is no save against either effect, but resistance to or
immunity to fire reduces or negates the fire damage.
Fiery Gaze (Su): A creature that meets Xaphan's gaze must
succeed on a DC 36 Will save or be affected as follows:
1st-round: The victim's blood begins to boil, dealing 3d6
points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a -2 circumstance
penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and
skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire
damage but does not negate the penalties.
2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches searing temperatures
and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the circumstance
penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh. The
#54
victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37
Fortitude save halves the fire damage but does not negate the
penalties.
3rd-round: The victim's blood erupts into an inferno and
explodes from its body dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the
victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the
fire damage but the victim is still stunned.
A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan's
gaze for one day. The save DC against the gaze is Charisma-based
and the Fortitude saves are Constitution-based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-animate dead, blasphemy (DC
27), detect magic, detect good, detect thoughts (DC 22), discern
location, fireball (DC 23 half), greater dispel magic, greater teleport
(self plus 50 pounds of objects only), improved invisibility (self
only), magic circle against good (DC 23), locate creature, polymorph
(self only), produce flame (DC 22), pyrotechnics (DC 22), resurrection,
scorching ray (3 rays), suggestion (DC 23), true seeing (DC 26),
unhallow, unholy aura (DC 28), wall of fire; 1/day-limited wish,
power word kill, symbol of fear (DC 26), symbol of weakness (DC
27). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spells: Duke Xaphan casts arcane spells as a 20th-level
sorcerer. His spell list is below. The saves are Charisma-based.
Spells Known (Cast per Day 9/8/8/8/8/8/8/7/7/7; save DC 20 +
spell level): 0-acid splash, arcane mark, dancing lights, daze, flare,
ghost sound, mage hand, ray of frost, touch of fatigue; 1st-cause
fear, charm person, disguise self, hypnotism, ray of enfeeblement;
2nd-arcane lock, gust of wind, misdirection, shatter, spider climb;
3rd-daylight, deep slumber, haste, nondetection; 4th-crushing

delayed blast fireball, finger of death, waves of exhaustion; 8th-binding,
sunburst, trap the soul; 9th-energy drain, prismatic sphere, wail of
the banshee.
Summon Devils (Sp): Three times per day, Xaphan can
automatically summon 2 barbed devils, bone devils, or horned
devils, or 1d4 bearded devils or hellstokers, or he can attempt to
summon 1d2 pit fiends with an 80% chance of success.
Regeneration (Ex): Xaphan takes normal damage from
good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects
with the good descriptor.
Hellstorm: Hellstorm
is a Large +4 unholy
flaming burst
falchion.

#Draconid 55
Breath Weapon (Su): Each head can breathe a jet of fire once
every 1d4 rounds in a 30-foot line. A jet deals 3d6 points of fire
damage per head. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves the
damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Poison (Ex): A draconid delivers its poison with each successful
bite attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Draconid Poison: Injury, Fortitude DC 21; initial and secondary
damage 1d6 Dexterity.
Web (Ex): A draconid can throw a web six times per day. This
is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against
targets up to one size category larger than the draconid. An
entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 21 Escape
Artist check or burst it with a DC 25 Strength check. Both are
standard actions. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and
the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.
Draconids often create sheets of sticky webbing 40 feet square.
They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can
also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must
succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they
stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web
attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus
if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while
pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 12 hit
points, and sheet webs have damage
reduction 5/-. Draconid webs have
fire resistance 5.
A draconid can move across its own
web at its climb speed and can pinpoint
the location of any creature touching
its web.
Skills: A draconid can always
take 10 on Climb checks, even if
rushed or threatened.

#Dragon, Dungeon 56
A dungeon dragon is
proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons and light
and medium armor and shields.
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a dungeon
dragon can emit a blast of warm mist in a 100-foot line or 50-foot
cone. Creatures caught in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Will
save or be affected as if by a confusion spell for 1 minute. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Dominate Monster (Sp): Three times per day, a dungeon
dragon can generate an effect identical to a dominate monster
spell (caster level is equal to the dragon's HD). An affected
creature can make a DC 21 Will save to resist the effects. The save
DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
A dungeon dragon uses this ability to populate its dungeon with
monsters it encounters in the surrounding terrain.
Change Shape (Su): At will, a dungeon dragon can polymorph
itself into any humanoid creature (as the polymorph spell, caster
level 15th). It never suffers disorientation as a result of this ability
and can remain in its humanoid form as long as it wishes.
Craft Crystal Ball (Su): No dungeon dragon is without its
crystal ball. The one thing dungeon dragon parents teach their
young is how to craft their own scrying crystals. Without this vital
piece of equipment, all of the dragon's labor is in vain. For the
purposes of constructing its own crystal ball, a dungeon dragon
automatically meets all the prerequisites-they are taught the
necessary skills and spells from birth. A dungeon dragon can only
innately create a basic crystal ball (see Wondrous Items in the
DMG). Those with an Intelligence score of 18 or higher often
create new crystal balls with additional powers.
Skills: Dungeon dragons have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and
Spot checks.

#Dragon, Smoke 57
Breath Weapon (Su): A smoke dragon's breath weapon
is a cone of thick, black smoke with a range of 20 feet. The
smoke cloud lasts 1d4 rounds before dispersing and can be
affected by wind. Creatures caught in the smoke must
succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save each round or spend that
round coughing and choking. A creature that chokes for 2
consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
per 2 HD of the smoke dragon. Each round a creature spends
in the smoke, the save DC increases by +1. The save DC is
Constitution-based. The smoke obscures vision and gives
concealment (20% miss chance) to creatures within it.
Smoke dragons are immune to the choking effects of their
own breath weapon as well as the breath weapon of other
smoke dragons.
Smoke Form (Ex): Once per day, a smoke dragon can
assume a smoky form as a free action. It can spend up to 1
minute per day per HD in smoke form. A smoke form dragon
can fly at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). The
ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell.
Skills: *Due to their coloration, smoke dragons
gain a +4 racial bonus to Hide checks in areas of
smoke or dense fog.

#Dragonship 58
Breath Weapon (Su): Three times per day, a
dragonship can belch forth a gout of fire in a 30-foot
line that deals 10d6 points of fire damage. A successful
DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage. The save
DC is Constitution-based.
Fire Vulnerability: A dragonship takes half again
as much damage (+50%) as normal from fire, regardless
of whether a save is allowed, or if the save is a
success or failure.
Navigate (Ex): A captain merely has to whisper
into the ear of the dragon-head and make a Profession
(sailor) check (DC 15) to get the dragonship to
understand its course. A dragonship never gets lost
on an ocean voyage, and has a 50% chance of auto
#59
matically being aware of any safe coastline, seaside
towns and villages, and hidden ocean dangers such as
reefs and sandbars (it only knows of such dangers if
they are in the volume of sea charts used in its
creation).
Winds (Su): At will, a dragonship can cause winds
to fill its sails. This operates as the control winds spell
(caster level 10th) with the restriction that it can
only increase the wind's force for the purposes of
propulsion. The winds are generated from a point
beyond and slightly above the dragonship's stern. A
dragonship cannot use these winds to attack; their
sole purpose is propulsion.
Skills: A dragonship has a +8 racial bonus on any
Swim check to perform some special action or avoid
a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in
a straight line.

#Elusa Hound 60
Aura Tracking (Su): If an elusa hound has "tasted"
the magical aura of a living creature (a creature it has
successfully used its detect magic ability against or a
spell it has successfully detected that was cast by such
a creature), it gains a +10 competence bonus to its
Survival check when tracking that target. The aura
must be fresh ("tasted" within the last 3 hours) or the
elusa hound does not gain this bonus. This bonus
stacks with the racial bonus the hound receives for
tracking by scent (see below).
Detect Magic (Su): Elusa hounds can detect magic,
as the spell (caster level 6th). This ability is always
active and can be dispelled, but the creature can
restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Trip (Ex): An elusa hound that hits with a bite
attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check
modifier) as a free action without making a touch
attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the
attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip
the elusa hound.
Skills: *Elusa hounds receive a +4 racial bonus
to Survival checks when tracking by scent.

#Encephalon Gorger 61
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an
encephalon gorger must hit an opponent up to
one size larger than itself with a claw attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it
wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold that
deals claw damage each round and allows it to use
its mindfeed ability.
Mindfeed (Su): An encephalon gorger can suck
brain fluid from a living creature with its fangs by
making a successful grapple check. If it pins the
foe, it drains cerebral fluid, dealing 1d4 points of
Intelligence drain each round the pin is maintained.
On each successful attack, the encephalon
gorger gains 5 temporary hit points. At Intelligence
0, a grappled foe collapses, helpless and
unconscious in a coma-like stupor.
Adrenal Surge (Ex): Twice per day, an encephalon
gorger can create an effect on itself
identical to a haste spell (caster level 10th).
Fast Healing (Ex): An encephalon gorger heals
5 points of damage each round so long as it has at
least 1 hit point.
Mindsense (Su): An encephalon gorger can
gauge the relative intelligence level of any creature
within 60 feet. This ability can be dispelled,
but the encephalon gorger can restart it as a free
action on its next turn. The creature often uses
this power to locate the most intelligent creature
in a group, whom it then targets for capture (or a
meal).
Mind Screen (Ex): The mind of an encephalon
gorger is an alien and dangerous place. Should a
creature target an encephalon gorger with a mind-
affecting effect (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects), telepathy, or psionic
mind-affecting effect or attack, it must succeed
on a DC 20 Will save or be driven permanently
insane (as by an insanity spell, caster level 15th).
The save DC is Intelligence-based.

#Fear Guard 63
Fear Aura (Su): A fear guard can radiate
a 20-foot radius fear aura as a free
action. A creature in the area must succeed
on a DC 16 Will save or be affected
as though by a fear spell (caster level
8th). A creature that successfully saves
cannot be affected again by the same
fear guard's aura for one day. The save
DC is Charisma-based.
Spell-like Abilities: At will-ray of enfeeblement,
darkness; 2/day-deeper darkness. Caster level 8th.
Wisdom Damage (Su): The touch of a fear guard
deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to a living foe if
it fails a DC 16 Fortitude save. A creature reduced to
Wisdom 0 dies. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Create Spawn (Su): Any living creature reduced
to Wisdom 0 by a fear guard becomes a fear guard
under the control of its killer within 2d6 hours. If a
bless spell is cast on the corpse before this time, it
prevents the transformation.
Daylight Weakness (Ex): A fear guard exposed to
natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) suffers
2d6 points of damage and immediately flees from the
source of light. A fear guard caught in sunlight cannot
attack and can only take a single move or attack
action in a round.
See in Darkness (Su): A fear guard can see perfectly
in darkness of any kind, even that created by
deeper darkness spells.
Skills: *A fear guard has a +8 racial bonus on Hide
checks in areas of darkness.

#Fire Crab (lesser) 64
Heat (Ex): The body of a fire crab generates intense heat,
dealing 1d4 points of fire damage with its touch (1d8 points of fire damage for greater fire crabs). Creatures attacking a fire crab
unarmed or with natural weapons takes fire damage each time
their attacks hit. Any melee hit by a fire crab deals fire damage.
#65
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a fire crab must
hit an opponent up to one size smaller with a claw attack. It
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Constrict (Ex): A fire crab that gets a hold of an opponent of
its size or smaller automatically deals claw and fire damage each
round it maintains the hold.
Tremorsense (Ex): Fire crabs can automatically sense
the location of anything within 60 feet that is in
contact with the ground.
Skills: A fire crab has a +4 racial bonus on Hide and
Spot checks.
A fire crab has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can
always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if
distracted or endangered. It can use the run action
while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
