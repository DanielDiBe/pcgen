#Aberrant 7

Oversized Weapon (Ex): An aberrant wields a Huge greatclub without penalty.


#Abyssal Wolf 8
Paralyzing Gaze (Su): Anyone within 40 feet meeting the gaze of an abyssal wolf must make a successful Will save (DC 16) or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Half-fiends and tieflings have a -2 penalty on their save. Once a successful save is made, the target is immune to the effects of that abyssal wolf's gaze attack for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Trip (Ex): An abyssal wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+9 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the abyssal wolf.
Favored Prey (Ex): An abyssal wolf has a +2 bonus on Listen, Sense Motive, and Spot checks against non-evil half fiends and tieflings.
Keen Scent (Ex): An abyssal wolf can detect prey within 60 feet by sense of smell. This range increases to 120 feet if the opponents are upwind; and decreases to 30 feet if downwind. By making a successful Wisdom check (DC 15) the abyssal wolf can determine whether a tiefling or half-fiend is present among the opponents.
Know Alignment (Su): Abyssal wolves always know the alignment of any creature they look upon. This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the abyssal wolf can activate it again as a free action on its next turn.
Skills: An abyssal wolf has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent. This bonus rises to +6 when tracking non-evil half fiends or tieflings by scent.



#Ahlinni (Cackle Bird) 9
Breath Weapon (Su): Once every three rounds as a standard action, an ahlinni can expel a pinkish gas in a 20-foot cone. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC Fortitude save or fall prone, laughing manically as if affected by a Tashaa's hideous laughter spell (caster level 4th). The effects last 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution- based.
Impale (Ex): When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals 2d8+4 points of damage on a successful strike with its bite attack.
Birdsong (Su): An ahlinni can freely communicate with any bird or bird-like creature (such as rocs, giant eagles, and giant owls), perfectly mimicking any bird song or vocalization. Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100 feet. In this case, this ability functions as a speak with animals spell (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Fast Healing (Ex): An ahlinni heals 2 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.
Skills: *An ahlinni has a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in treetops. An ahlinni has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks, and can take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Angel, Empyreal 10
An empyreal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Radiant Blast (Su): Once per day, an empyreal can increase the radiance of its form and release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 feet that deals 15d6 points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can attempt a DC 21 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is Constitution- based.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-aid, continual flame, detect evil, discern lies (DC 19), dispel magic, holy smite (DC 18), invisibility (self only), remove curse (DC 17), remove disease (DC 17), remove fear (DC 15); 2/day-blade barrier (DC 20), cure moderate wounds (DC 16), flame strike (DC 19), scorching ray (3 rays); 1/day-heal, raise dead. Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Spells: Empyreals can cast spells as 13th-level clerics. An empyreal has access to any two of the following domains: Air, Destruction, Good, Law, or War (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based. Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (6/6/ 6/5/4/3/2/1; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-create water, guidance, light, purify food and drink, read magic, resistance; 1st-bless (x2), bless water, command, divine favor (x2); 2nd- align weapon, bull's strength, consecrate, hold person(x2), silence; 3rd- cure serious wounds,daylight, invisibility purge, searing light (x2); 4th-dimensional anchor, divine power, inflict critical wounds, summon monster IV; 5th-greater command, mark of justice, plane shift; 6th-harm, planar ally; 7th-summon monster VII. Domain Spells (Good, War): 1st-protection from evil; 2nd- spiritual weapon; 3rd-magic vestment; 4th-holy smite; 5th-dispel evil; 6th-blade barrier; 7th-holy word.

Aura of Goodness (Su): An empyreal radiates an aura in a 30-foot radius spread around its form. Any non-evil creature in this area attempting to attack the empyreal must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be overcome with awe and unable to take any action, other than a move action that round. Evil creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be unable to even look at that empyreal for one day. An affected evil creature functions as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking that empyreal. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the aura of goodness of that empyreal for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.	SOURCEPAGE:p.11

#Arcanoplasm 11
Acid (Ex): An arcanoplasm secretes a highly corrosive acid that dissolves only flesh. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Constrict (Ex): An arcanoplasm deals automatic slam and acid damage with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an arcanoplasm must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Arcane Spell Mimicry (Ex): An arcanoplasm can mimic any arcane spell of 4th level or lower that is cast within 30 feet of it. The spell takes effect on the arcanoplasm's next action, has a caster level of 7th, and does not require any components. The save against a mimicked spell has a DC of 12 + the level of the spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Absorb Arcane Magic (Ex): Any arcane spell cast at an arcanoplasm is automatically absorbed. This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell would otherwise deal (non-damaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell level of the spell). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they affect an arcanoplasm. An arcanoplasm cannot absorb divine magic and is affected by it normally.
Amorphous (Ex): Arcanoplasms have no discernable front or back and are not subject to critical hits. They cannot be flanked.
Arcanesense (Su): An arcanoplasm can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 100 feet. This functions as a detect evil spell but there is no chance the arcanoplasm is stunned and it is not blocked by stone, lead, or other material.

#12
Blindsight (Ex): An arcanoplasm's entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.
Immunities (Ex): Arcanoplasms are immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.
Skills: An arcanoplasm has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

#Asrai 12
Spells: An asrai casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer. The save DC against a spell cast by an asrai is 12 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Typical Sorcerer Spells Prepared (Cast per Day 6/7/ 5; save DC 12 + spell level): 0-dancing lights, daze (x2), detect magic, flare, resistance, touch of fatigue; 1st-hypnotism, obscuring mist, reduce person, sleep; 2nd-Tashaa's hideous laughter, touch of idiocy. Spell-Like Abilities: 2/day-control water, fog cloud, obscuring mist. Caster level 5th.
Cold (Su): The touch of an asrai is supernaturally cold. All damage dealt from an asrai's natural attacks is cold damage. This ability is constant, but the asrai can suppress or resume it at will as a free action.
Water Dependent (Su): An asrai that moves more than 50 feet from her water source, can survive on land for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG). Lost Constitution points are immediately restored if she is returned to the water. If her Constitution reaches 0, she dies, her form collapsing into a puddle of water.
Skills: An asrai has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Asrai use their Dexterity modifier (instead of Strength modifier) on Swim checks.

#Barbegazi (Ice Gnome) 14
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-chill metal (DC 12), icicle blast (as burning hands, but shards of ice that deal cold damage) (DC 11). Caster level 3rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +2 racial bonus.
Snow Move (Ex): Because of its oversized flat feet, a barbegazi can walk on top of deep snow and suffers no penalties when moving through snowy terrain.
Skills: Barbegazis receive a +2 racial bonus to Craft (trapmaking), Hide and Survival checks. *The Hide bonus increases to +6 in their natural environment.

#Bedlam 14
Chaos Burst (Su): Once per round as a standard action, a bedlam can release a burst of crackling gray energy in a 20-foot radius around itself. Lawful creatures caught in the area take 5d8 points of damage and are staggered for 1d6 rounds. Non-lawful and non- chaotic creatures take 3d8 points of damage, but are not staggered. A DC 18 Will save halves the damage. Chaotic-aligned creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution based.
Chaotic Resonance (Su): A bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos; an invisible and ever-changing ring of chaotic matter. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within 20 feet of the b e d l a m . Spellcasters in the area must make a s u c c e s s f u l caster level check (DC 18) each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item used within this area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round. A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. The check DC and save DC is Constitution based. Spells with the "chaotic" descriptor that are cast within this area function as if they were empowered (as by the Empower Spell feat). Chaotically-aligned weapons (anarchic weapons) deal an extra 1d6 points of damage while in this area (i.e., an anarchic weapon deals an extra 3d6 points of chaotic damage against lawful- aligned foes). Lawful-aligned weapons are unaffected by this aura.
Detect Law (Su): A bedlam can continuously detect law as the spell (caster level 10th), though there is no chance of it becoming stunned by overwhelming lawful auras. It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
Immunity to Chaos (Ex): The bedlam cannot be affected by any spell, spell-like ability, weapon, magic item, or supernatural effect that has the chaotic or anarchic descriptor. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this immunity and can attack the bedlam normally.
Immunity to Transformation (Ex): No mortal magic can affect or fix a bedlam's ever-shifting chaotic form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into its new shape for a moment, but it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action at the start of its next turn.
Resistance to Law Spells (Ex): The bedlam has SR 20 against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects with the "law" descriptor. This spell resistance also applies to spells of the Law domain.
Skills: *A bedlam's grayish coloration grants it a +8 racial bonus to Hide checks when in areas of thick fog or smoke.

# Giant Beetle Shared
Tremorsense (Ex): Giant beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.

#Beetle, Giant Blister 16
Blister Spray (Ex): Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, a blister beetle can shoot a jet of inky black liquid in a 20-foot line. A creature within the area must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid the spray. On a failed save, the target takes 1d3 points of acid damage and a -2 conditional modifier on attack rolls and ability and skill checks for the next 1 minute (10 rounds) from painful blisters and welts that quickly appear on exposed skin. A DC 10 Heal check or any cure spell heals the blisters and negates the penalties. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Skills: *Blister beetles have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in their natural surroundings.
#Beetle, Giant Saw-tooth 17
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a giant saw- toothed beetle must hit an opponent up to one size larger with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold.
#Beetle, Giant Water 17
Ink Cloud (Ex): A giant water beetle can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the giant water beetle normally uses to escape. All vision within the cloud is obscured.
Water Dependent (Ex): Giant water beetles can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution. After that, refer to the suffocation rules in the DMG.
Watersense (Ex): Giant water beetles can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with water.
Skills: *Underwater, a giant water beetle has a +4 bonus on Hide and Spot checks. A giant water beetle has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

#Bloodsuckle 18
Blood Drain (Ex): A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. Once it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases the victim so it can continue to rely on it as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts (see below) unless they are extremely hungry.
Create Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special sap into the victim that disrupts the synapses in the victim's brain and transforms it into a host if it fails a DC 18 Will save. This acts as a dominate monster spell (caster level 8th) with no duration. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. A victim that fails its Will save becomes a host for the bloodsuckle, and returns to the plant whenever it calls. A host is normally only used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack, it may summon its hosts to defend it. A host with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed another Will save (same DC) with a +4 bonus to break the effects of the bloodsuckle's control.
Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bloodsuckle must hit a creature of any size with a tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can drain blood.
Seed (Ex): Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a host's body. The host wanders off, and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open, growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. At Constitution 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell destroys the seedling as do spells such as limited wish, wish, or miracle.
# 19
Summon Host (Ex): A bloodsuckle can generate a high- pitched whine that only its hosts can hear. A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant. So long as the bloodsuckle and its host are on the same plane of existence, the host hears and answers the call. Usually, a bloodsuckle only calls its hosts when it becomes hungry for blood-about once every three days.
Blindsight (Ex): A bloodsuckle has no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.
Host Sense (Ex): A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any of its hosts to a range of 100 feet.
