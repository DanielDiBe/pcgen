Grab			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption	VISIBLE:YES																				DESC:If you hit with the indicated attack, you deal normal damage and can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Grab only works against opponets at least on size category smaller than you. You have the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of your body you used in the grab to hold the opponent. If you choose to do the latter, you take a -20 penalty on your CMB check to make and maintain the grappel, but do not gain the grappled condition yourself. Each successful grapple check you make during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold.										BONUS:VAR|CMB_Grapple|4
Pounce		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary.AttackOption	VISIBLE:YES																				DESC:When you make a charge, you can make a full attack.

This works just like the combat maneuver, but you do not need to make a check, and rather merely have to move over opponents in your path. Targets of a trample take %1d%2+%3 points of damage. Targets of the trample can make an attack of opportunity but at a -4 penalty. If targets forego an attack of opportunity, they can attempt to avoid you and receive a Reflex save (DC %4) to take half damage. You can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.|TrampleDamageDice|TrampleDamageDieSize|TrampleDamageBonus|TrampleDC	BONUS:VAR|TrampleDamageBonus|STR*3/2	BONUS:VAR|TrampleDC|10+(HD/2)+STR	BONUS:VAR|TrampleDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Trample)	SOURCEPAGE:p.3
