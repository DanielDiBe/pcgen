Bestiary D, E & F

Darkmantle: None of the derived stats add up correctly for the Str (11) and Dex (15) presented. AC should be 15 (missing +2 dex). Ref save should be +5. Slam should be +3 (1d4). CMB +1 (+5 grapple); CMD +13. Looks like the values listed for STR and DEX are in error, if I change them to STR 17 and DEX 11 the number add up. The skill bonuses are off as well but I don't know exactly where without knowing the correct Ability stats but I think Stealth is missing the +3 bonus for being a class skill (if DEX = 11).
