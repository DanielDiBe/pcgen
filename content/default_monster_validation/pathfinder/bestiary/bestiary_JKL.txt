Bestiary J,K & L

Lizard (Monitor): Poison (Su)? shouldn't a normal animals poison be Extrodinary?
Lizard (Giant Frilled): IN AC +8 is listed as Armor, shouldn't this be listed as Natural?
Lizardfolk: The Swim skill bonus does not reflect the shield penalty (understandably)


Lycanthrope, Werewolf: Not enough skill points for the skills listed, need 2 more than it has.
