Bestiary V & W

Vampire: The sample vampire has 1 more feat than she should have. Also, she has skill ranks as if the vampire template was applied before class levels were added (and gained 5 skill points from the +2 INT), but the Vampite template says it can be applied to creatures with 5 or more HD.

Vargouille: Should have AC 15, stats are missing the +1 for Small Size.

Will-o'-Wisp: Perception should be +17, missing the from the Alertness feat.
