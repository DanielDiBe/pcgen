# What's new for v6.00.0

Welcome to PCGen v6.00.0, the latest stable release of PCGen. In this release 
we have introduced a new user interface and made substantial changes under the 
hood including hundreds of new features. 
The highlights of the changes for PCGen 6.0 are listed below: 
  
## Major Changes

* New user interface
	* A faster, more responsive GUI, particularly when using multiple characters.
	* A redesigned interface intended to be friendlier and more informative
	* Support for Java 7 and Open JDK
	* Faster startup time
* Improved performance
* Install to non admin location on Windows
* Full spell descriptions in RSRD and Pathfinder
* Command line PDF generation

## LST Changes:

* Choice tags revamped and rigorously parsed
* Choice tags now only provide a choice - a separate tag (e.g. BONUS) is used to apply the choice
* All shipped data has been run through the LST converter to bring it up to 6.0 standards
