Link												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.
Share Spells										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:The druid may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A druid may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.
Ability Score Increase									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:The animal companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.
Devotion											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.
Multiattack											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality													DESC:An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty.

Deliver Touch Spells									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural											DESC:If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.
Empathic Link										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural											DESC:The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link's limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.
Scry on Familiar										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike												DESC:If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day.
Speak with Master										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.
Speak with Animals of Its Kind							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties), bats with bats, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, monkeys with other simians, rats with rodents, toads with amphibians, and weasels with ermines and minks. Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.
Speak One Language									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural											DESC:A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice as a supernatural ability.
Spell Resistance				KEY:Spell Resistance ~ Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary											DESC:If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.
